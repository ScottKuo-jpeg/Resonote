🎼Jogan the Joe Rogan experience Joe night all day.John, what's happening how much it's very nice to meet you you too thanks for having.I know you're in the middle of a project you're doing a project with David Chase right that's about MK Ultra and yes, he has gotten the rights to this book, you know this book project Mind Control and he's interested in adapting it into a series Well I am endlessly fascinated with the subject so as soon as I heard about it and they said the series is coming but you could talk to the guy who wrote the book now I'm like let's go So here we go, Project Min control Si, Si Gotlieb, the CIA and the tragedy of ML.which really is a tragedy you know, I really got, know I knew about it, but I really didn't get completely obsessed with it until chaos, T O'Neill's you read that and when you realize what the MK Ultra program involved and how long it ran and how insane it is and it essentially had no oversight and these people were just running these wild mind experiments on American citizens and,。Nobody went to jail for it. Yeah, that's part of the crazy thing. One of the things I I really try to focus on in the book, especially the second half in of the book or the consequences of M K Ultra in society, but also just what happened to these people afterwards, the victims of M K Ultra, they launched several lawsuits against the CIA and basically really nothing much came out of it. They got paid a little bit of money. But the people who perpetrated M K Ultra.。They didn't really face any consequences. And so I'm glad you brought that up because one of the things I really try to talk about in the latter part of the book are what are the failures of oversight that allowed this to happen, How is that possible, How could people within the CIA be doing these kinds of drug experiments on people unwittingly and yet never face any hardly consequences for their actions? So I delve into that pretty deeply, How did you get interested in the subject, Like what was your introduction to it.😊。I feel like my introduction is a little bit different probably for most people, because I didn't know that much about M Kulttra. And I was doing my Ph D at U T. and I studied the history of science, but my dissertation was on a group of scientists within the intelligence. They had connections to the intelligence community. They were called the science attachches out of the State Department. The State Department would send these science attachches to different embassies.。American embasies around the world. And the CIA was very interested in these people because, hey, we have these scientists going abroad. Maybe they can interrogate foreign scientists and figure out what kind of research they're doing. So that kind of LED me into being interested in scientists within the intelligence community. And from that, I learned about, you know, Siney Gotlie. But also mostly my initial interest was this man named Stanley Lovell, who.😊Was essentially the Sydney Gotleb of the OS. So prior to the CIA, the US had the OS, the Office of Strategic Services during World War I, and that was the US kind of Intelligence Agency.And Stanley Love was in charge of a branch within the O S S called the research and development branch. And that was the branch that was composed of a group of scientists whose job was to basically invent the deadly weapons, create ingenious disguises, forged documents for secret agents that are sent abroad. So my first stuff., my first book the Drry Tris department. It's about Stanley Love in that group. And one of the things they do are drug experiments in truth drug experiments, trying to find out whether it's possible to give someone, you know, captured enemy.Some kind of drug to make them tell the truth during an interrogation. And it turns out when I was researching that book, I came across a series of depositions, of which Siney Gotlie is one of the depons who would later lead M Ca Utra. And in these depositions, he was talking about how when he was.Assigned to be in charge of M. K Utra.He didn't really know where to begin. He didn't know anything about mind control. So one of the things that he did, he went into the old O S S files and was starting to look at the drug experiments that Stanley Love was doing. And so I thought that's the connection between Stanley Love. my first book. And now this one. So that naturally LED me into becoming interested in M. K Utra. So a lot of the things that Sidney Gotliep was up to with M. K Ultra. His blueprint was basically Stanley Love. Just imagine being a government agency, the CIA, the O S S, whatever it is. And then someone says, hey, figure out if we can control.😊People's minds and that's where you start from right It's not like Si Gottlie was some expert hypnotist or really was a psychologist or really understood human minds. No, they started a program going what can we do, How can we fuck with people's minds. How can we figure out how to control people's minds.Yeah.And they did it for decades. Yeah, yeah, so they're probably still doing it now. Well, even before M K Utra. So there are a couple programs that precede it I mean, you know, so during World War I, the OsS was already doing truth drug experiments, not with LSD, because that wasn't really around then, but with THC acetate. They would inject it into cigarettes and have people smoke it and get. They would get high. And the will supposedly, supposedly, the idea was that it lowers their inhibitions. And so maybe they'll be more un needable to talking.They just gave him splits. Yeah, exactly They basically gave him split. They were a European smoke. Yeah, No, and so one of the guys who was actually on the Tru drug Committee that was kind of overseeing these drug experiments during World War2 was Harry Anslinger, who, of course, is launching this crusade against marijuana. And at the same time, he's overseeing these experiments about dozsing people with the THC. So it's very ironic that that was the case. It's, it's really stunning the kind of damage those people did to just.😊.Our trust in government, what we you know what we know about these psychedelic compounds and drugs and like what they did with them that completely changed our idea of what the future of legalization and of all these's there's so much negative impact to what they did on top of what they did they essentially created Ted Kinsky Well I'm a little Are you on the fence on that, I'm a little skeptical of whether Mk Ultra is connected to that.

But certainly Harvard and the LSD experiment., they did at Harvard. And I don't imagine they would do that without the involvement of the government. without them wanting to have access to research, if you have people at Harvard that doing really critical LSD studies on people humiliation studies. with him in particular, the study that he was involved in was Henry Murray was the guy who was running that is like a psychological experiment about I think it was interpersonal relationships where he would basically interrogate them and berate them and see how they reacted.Now, Henry Murray, who ran that experiment with Ted Kzynski, he did have connections to the intelligence community. I just am not convinced that he was funded by Mk Ultra or something. his connection, he has a couple of connections. One connection that I'd mention in my first book, the Dity tricks Department. He was tasked with creating psychological profiles of German leaders like Hitler. And so the idea was that he would kind of figure out what their psychology was. and maybe we could find ways to exploit that psychology. So Stanley Lovell, who is the head of this.Indeed deep branch of the O S. He read Henry Murray's psychological profile of Hitler, and he decided maybe I can figure out a way to kind of drive Hitler crazy by using this. So Henry Murray, Henry Murray said that Hitler had a very feminine kind of personality. He was on the border between masculine and feminine and you know, at least that's what Henry Murray is saying in this psychological profile. Stanley level reads that. And he thinks maybe I can exploit this by.Geting one of the gardeners near the Eagleagleness, where Hitler often had some meetings. There were some gardeners down there. We can get an agent to slip a gardener of some female sex hormone. in that gardener.That gardender can inject it into the beats that are destined for Hitler's plate. Hitler is going to eat it. and it's going to like exacerbate this feminine tendency, and it's going to make him go crazy or something like that. That was the plan. that never actually happened. But so Henry Murray is kind of connected to the O SS in that sense. And then later, he developed some personality tests for the O SS and CIA. I believe it was for recruits to give these to recruits to determine whether they kind of have the psychological profile that would be amenable to being in an intelligence organization..😊See that they recently did a scan of some blood that was found in Hitler's bunker and they determined that he has a very unusual gene expression can you find out what that is, it's something that would lead to him potentially having a micro penis?Yeah, which is in earth.You know, like the most obvious psychological profile ever, a guy wants to destroy everything of the world. He's got a tiny dick. maybe Henry Murray was onto something. Yeah, I'm sure he was. Hitler's DNA I sure there is something some research behind it. Like somebody must have said something about him. Yeah, Yeah, I hadn't heard of that. I didn't know that. Hitler's DNA reveals Nazi leader likely had syndrome that can affect genitals Research say According to the Cleveland Clinic, the syndrome can disrupt the process that drive puberty and manifest in symptoms that include undecended.Testicles and a micro penis in that wild. Yeah, it is totally makes sense. Like we should kill everyone with a micro penis. They're too dangerous. It is, you know, maybe.Useful to be careful about correlation and causation. A lot of people probably have this. And that doesn't cause them to be coming out there. I'm just kidding. obviously like the nicest people out there just to have a micro penis couldn't maybe his temper I don't know. Well, he was also on a bunch of drugs. You know, he had like a special doctor that just worked for him those videos of him at sporting events whatever like back and forth.'s93 completely out of his mind on something. have you read Norman Os.itz yes, I I don't know if I've read the whole thing. I know I dipped into it. I can't remember it. Yeah,,, it is the entire Nazi Army whos met out of their minds. Yeah, and, you know, what these, there are a lot of LSD experiments after World War2, within the CIA and M K Ultra, of course, but also Army LSD experiments that aren't really connected to M K Ultra. So I don't go into them that much in this book. but there are, you know, the British are doing LSD experiments on their personnel, the US military does, too.😊And you know, it, it's just some of the stories that come out of it are very silly and really and just insane. But there, there is one document I found that talks about how.They were giving these two Army personnel, these two soldiers, LSD to see how they reacted to it. And so each of them took the LSD. They were in like a padded room, isolated with each other. So nobody else was there, And they started hallucinating. And one of them pretended to like start smoking a cigarette. And he didn't actually have a cigarette. He had nothing. you know, but he just pretended to smoke a cigarette. And the other guy was off in his own world. And then the first guy, he reached into his pocket and took out an imaginary pack of cigarettes. He didn't actually have one. It was just an empty hand. But he was just.llucinating that there was one and he reached it out to the other guy basically to offer, hey, do you want a cigarette And the other guy looked at it and he said, no, I couldn't take your last one. It was just an empty hand. There was nothing No, I couldn't like this was shared hallucination or something wow.😊Wow.I mean, also back then, we didn't really know too much about that stuff. So they were kind of gathering information about what would happen if you gave someone LSD. Y, that was, that's kind of the motivation for M Ky Utra in the first place. There were several.Motivating factors. One of them is, how do we get prisoners to speak during an interrogation, Maybe theres some, maybe there is some kind of truth drug that can give them to tell us the secrets that we want to know. Another is maybe we can use this to discredit individuals like Fidel Castro. Let's say we dose him with LSD before a big speech, He appears to be crazy and his people are going to lose trust in him because he's making nonsense. You know, he's just talking gibberish. Was that proposed, Oh yeah, Yeah, There was proposed a plan to put LSD into cigars that would sneak into.Castros kind of place that he would smoke before he gave a speech. What I don't understand about that is they were trying to kill him. So yeah, if they couldn't get poison into his cigars, why they think theyd get the original plan was to discredit him and then the later plan was to kill him. Yeah so there were a couple original plans to discredit him One is to sneak him LSD to make him appear insane so that his people will lose faith in him. Another one was to slip what's called thalium salts into his shoe.

And these are deies. They make your hair fall out. And so the idea was that, you know, he's got this mas masculine allure with his big beard. But if we can slip these deies into his shoes and he puts them on, his beard's gonna fall out And like Samson. He's gonna to lose his power or something like That was the idea. So Si Gotley was kind of involved in some of these that I talk about in the book. Another one. So you have the LSD. You have the depatory. Another one was to Photoshop images, Basically of Castro with a bunch of beautiful women around him and like a buffet of food.In front of him and to have a captain underneath it that said my ration is different to indicate like I'm getting all the benefits of, you know this you know the spoils of society while my people are going hungry. And so you know, the idea was to spread this around Cuba and have people resent Castro for indulging in all these. Well, that one's actually reasonable. a little bit more than the other. That one's probably the closest to accurate. Yeah So those were attempts to discredit Castro. And then there were several attempts to assassinate him that Si gottb and others involved kind of in this story.Do so some of the main assassination attempts on Castro involved his hobby of ocean diving. So he liked to dive in the ocean. And one idea was that, what if we get this really beautiful shell that he would just be.Unable to pass up., it would be so beautiful that if anyone swam by it, they would obviously want to pick it up. We packed the shell full of explosives and put it on have some kind of trigger mechanism for when you pick it up that detonates the explosives. So when he's underwater, he's going to swim by this. He's going to see this beautiful shell. He's going to pick it up and is going to explode. But it turns out they couldn't really figure out a shell big enough that would catch his interest, you know, So that never happened, another concept with his scuba diving hobby is that what if we gift him a scuba diving suit, there are people kind of negotiate.😊For the return of the Baypis prisoners So what if we get one of those lawyers to gift Castro a suit and in that suit, we would lace it with some kind of poison or some kind of fungus that would cause him to break out and what develop some kind of disease. but it turns out the guy that they wanted to give him the suit had already given him a diving suit. And so it was like oh we can't use him anymore.Wow.and they were the people running it that was the best they could do. but it's just the concept of not having any experience whatsoever in any studies about mind control and just given this assignment.What do you know about mind control, What can we do How much does it work, What did the Nazis learn during World War I because they did a lot of experiments right they're doing a lot of experiments and it is you know I mentioned the OS is doing truth drug experiments, The Nazis are doing truth drug experiments in their concentration camps as well and the British are doing some truth drug experiments during World War I as well you can get the British ones online at least the postworl War I ones was it 1950s can have you' seen the British LSD studies Oh you haven't seen it No I don't.It's wonderful. You should watch it. Well'll watch it real quick 'cause it's kinda of hilarious. They start breaking out. They can't they can't you have seen think want a row and some of them start laughing in the middle of doing the taskca they just start laughing un controltrollable when they sit down. Yeah, Well you know, during I mentioned those like THC acetate experiments during World War2. these guys giant smiles in their face.Yeah, this guy's having a guard go of it. Yeah, he, he might have been having a downer or something. He had to re be removed from the experiment after 35 minutes. Look at the radio operator try to figure out how to work it. It just, they is so confused.And eventually, they just start laying down and just laugh like these guys. these guys just can't.Yeah, and these THC experiments during World War that guys for some of the people, they would give them this THC, they would smoke it through a cigarette and you know some of the reactions it talked about was it made them just uncontrollably start laughing and it put them in a good mood like some of the reactions were oh yeah, I mean, they were just getting these people high and they were reacting to It didn't make them tell the truth No, no, of course not it did actually make them talk more though, because they actually recorded these interviews and they would count the number of words per minute.😊These people spoke, and it turns out after they smoked this, they would, they would talk about like 40% more words per minute. but it's not that this guaranteed the truth. They would they would just it just rambling They're talking about cartoons. Yeah, it's.It just what other drugs did they experiment, What did they experiment with amphetamines as, Oh yeah, So one well, I should mention that M K Ultra was broken into 149 sub projectsjects. So M K Ultra was the umbrella term. and within M K Ultra, there are 149 sub projectsjects that were kind of farmed out to in many cases, independent researchers who might be working at a hospital or a prison or a university or something like that. one of the main people who is running these studies is a guy at named Harris Isbeel.At the Lexington narcotic Farm, this is where drug addicts could go to get treatment for their addiction. Prisoners could go there as well.And whenever Siney Gottlieb found a drug that he was interested in, he would basically just give it to Harris Isel, who could try it out on these prisoners to see how they reacted. and then Isabel would write reports back to Godtlieb. So he tried P psilocybin when that came out LSD, but also stuff like, I mean, heroin, the CIA was particularly interested in heroin because if you can induce an addiction in a captured agent, let's say, then you can use that as leverage and interrogation, the withdrawal symptoms. So you get them addicted to heroin and then use the withdrawal symptoms.Well, if you tell us about this, maybe'll you know give you little So that was at least the concept. But there were, I mean, dozens and dozens of different kinds of drugs they were testing just to see how people reacted to them and if any of them could be used as a potential truth drug. The heroin one actually makes sense. I never thought of that. Yeah Well, of the one of the ironies as well about this experiment that I mentioned, you know Harris is Bell and giving these prisoners all these drugs. the prisoners are in this place. it's called the narcotic form because they're supposed to be getting off drugs. know they're supposed to be, you know.During them of their addiction, at the same time, they're giving them all these drugs to test them out and then as a reward for participating in these trials, they had two options.

They could get like a positive letter in the parole board and like 100 bucks or something, or they could go to the drug bank window, stick out their arm, and they would get a needle full of heroin as a reward. So they were supposed to be getting off drugs. and yet you're incentivizing them to participate in these drug trials by giving them drugs.Wow.This episode brought to you by visible when your phone plans as good as visible, you've got to tell your people it's the ultimate wireless hack to save money and still get great coverage and a reliable connection get one line wireless with unlimited data and hotspot for $25 a month taxes and fees included all on Verizon's 5G network plus now for a limited time new members can get the visible plan for just $19 a month for the.First 26 months use promo code switch 26 and save beyond the season It's a deal so good you're gonna to want to tell your people switch now at visible dot co slashrogan Ter apply limited time offers subject to change see visible do co for plan features and network management details wow yeah so that's one of 149 sub projects.Do you, are you aware that heroin was created as it was a substitute for people that were addicted to morphine. no, no, Yeah, I di that, that's correct, right? Search that.I'm pretty sure that's correct. Yeah, they, they came up with heroin to treat people that were addicted to morphine which.What, you know, you know, it's well, that's like oxycon giving them oxycontin if they're addicted to heroin, it's the same thing yeah.But getting someone addicted to that and then pulling it away from them seems like it would be very effective in terms of like getting getting them to give up information. Yeah, that was the idea. And so here it is. we put it into our sponsor perplexity. heroin created as a morphine treatment.Originally developed in late 19th centuries, a medical drug that was indeed marketed as an improved non addictive alternative to morphine. And as a cough suppressant. Hey, what do you know, Yeah, how nuts, Who what company came up with it.Germ bear, there you go. F bear. I think at the same time, they were doing this, they just find out if it's true that.acetoettopine is what's toxic in  Tylen. All correct, I find out it's true that at the same time, they decide that acetaetopine was too dangerous. I think that is you Yeah, I mean, that the substance.You know, that's Tylenol's the name brand.That's the question did they poor Jamie, if you hear his voice says gentlemen, informed the people at home, poor Jamie got a tooth pulled last night it was it rough. And he like not even yeah, excuse me. last night you were in pain Today, he got a tooth pulled and he's got what looks like a softball stuffed in his cheek.OhDid did Bear decide not to release ace of meopine during the same time period.During the pandemic, I got fascinated with thecetaminophen because I read this horrible story with this poor lady who got Covid and she was in real pain. So she took a bunch of aceta. She took a bunch of tyylenol and kept taking it and apparently didn't realize how dangerous it is to overdose on Tylenol. And she died of liver poison. Yeah, And I was like, oh my God, how many people die of liver poison. It's like 500 a year in this country. It's like acetaminopin. It's scary stuff.😔Yeah.ItWas not being actively held back by bear at the same period that it promoted heroin and aspen. It was simply not yet recognized or marketed the way those drugs were. And as development adoption followed a different path. Exing historical accounts focused more on scientific uncertainty and competing drugs than on deliberate suppression campaign by bear. I don't think I was, I don't think they were saying in this article that I read that it was a that they were suppressing it, that they decided not to focus on it because it was dangerous.嗯。Why, whycetominophen last early clinicians favored feaceceadine and aceta, How does that work, Was niide acenyide, despite their later recognized toxicity and instead of acetoopinees's advantages, but safety profile at therapeutic doses was not clearly distinguished at first.Yeah.Okay, anyway, well we're getting off track I was just gonna to say one of the ironic things, too, with some of these M ultra sub projectsjects, they're interested in finding these supposed truth drugs that could get someone to tell the truth during an interrogation, But it turns out the even just the threat of giving someone a truth drug turned out to be a lot more effective than any drug that they actually tried out. So, for instance, in an interrogation, if you tell someone that this is a truth drug and I'm going to give it to you. And you know, it's gonna to make you tell the truth. that can lower their defense.And a bit in the sense that the person who takes this that might give them kind of the permission to be able to talk because it makes them think, well, I couldn't have stop myself. Well, you know, I mean, they gave me this truth drug. Of course, I'm gonna have to say this. So I can't be blamed. No one's gonna blame me. So it takes kind of the burden off their shoulders. if they think they've been given a truth drug, even if they haven't Just given them a sugar pill. So that actually turned out to be a lot more effective than any of the drugs that they actually tried. that totally makes sense. They did the same thing with hypnotism too. The hypnotism turned out to be not that effective in.At least in an interrogation. But if you could convince someone that they had been hypnotized, even if they hadn't, then that could be effective. So, for instance.This is what a guy called Martin Orin. He was one of the psychologists who was in charge of one of these sub projectss, but he he put forward what's called the hypnotic situation, not hypnotism, but the hypnotic situation. So, for instance, you pretend to hypnotize someone, the person you're interrogating and they know they're not hypnotized they obviously can tell that, you know you're not controlling me nothing's happening. However, you start saying things like you know, I'm hypnotizing you and your hands are getting warmer and they're going to think to themselves another not.

Under the table, you secretly implanted a heater and that their hands actually are getting warmer because where they're sitting, there's this heater under that that they don't know exists. and it's making their hands warmer. So after a certain period of time, they start thinking to themselves, maybe I am being hypnotized like the things that he's saying are actually happening And so if you can make them think that they've been hypnotized again, that lowers their resistance because I mean, who could blame me for talking now, I've been hypnotized. I couldn't help myself but talk.At least that's the idea. It's just so fascinating to me how much time and effort was spent.Just studying how to control people's minds and and trying to come up with ways to do it. Yeah,, it must have been really exciting to be them. I mean, I think what they did is horrible. I I don't, you know, I'm not in any way for giving M K Utra for what they did. However, Boy, it must have been fun.Yeah.Just to have no oversight, no one even knows you exist. You, you kind of get this impression by looking at some of these M K ultra documents, especially at the beginning before the Frankelson incident. when Frank Olson eventually dies after one of these experiments. And so that kind of that definitely puts a damper on a lot of things that are going on before that, though, I do get the sense that.嗯。It's almost like there are a bunch of guys just trying to know, play around with each other in a way, even though what they're doing is completely unethical. But they would just be dosing like the CIA coffee pot and see what happens to people who are taking drinks of it. just I mean, the rationale is that, well, if the Soviets possess some kind of hallucinogenic drug And they were going going to release it into the water supply of a city, we need to know how people would react to that because we need to know how to defend against that. Therefore, we should be doing that to people just to see how they react to it so that we know.What kind of signs to look for in case the Soviets do that Did't they dose up a town in France I don't think the CIA was connected to that. I mean, I think it actually was like an ergot poisoning that came from the bread from the I think so, but yeah there was some speculation that it was purpose Yeah the town's called Po St Espriri I believe but yeah, there were multiple dozens of people who came down with hallucinogenic symptoms. they were one guy stripped naked and started running around the street multiple people died after this..That was one of the things that led the CIA to become really interested in hallucinogens because if a poisoning from a bakery could cause that much havoc within this one French town, how much more damaging would it be if the Soviets did that to a city's water supply And so that kind of just CIA that's the justification so they starting the coffee pots and they're running brothels Oh yeah that's the crazy one Operation midnight climax Look at up folks because it's really crazy they had their own brothels and they would use two ways.With cameras behind them, and they would dose the Johns up. they'd give would you like a drink a I'll have a drink get work a drink he's going be a prostitute and have some, he's tripping out of his mind while he's being recorded by Jolly West the guy who actually ran that is a guy named George White and he was involved in the Os. So he was I mentioned Stanley level the T acetate George White was the guy who was hired to do that in the.YesThen Sydney Godlie, when he's thinking I need to do these drug experiments for myself, Who am I going to get it to do it for me, I need someone who has connections to the underworld who has criminal connections. George White was a bureau of narcotics officer. And so Godlie was going through the OS files and it turns out oh this guy's already done these experiments. I'm going to hire him. So that's how George White eventually gets involved in the CIA stuff. Wow I can't wait for this show..Cause David Chase gets a hold of a subject like this is There's so much room. Like it's so endlessly fascinating. Yeah Im, I'm really excited. Obviously, for me, I mean, it's just so lucky that he happened to be interested in this kind of topic. I mean, there are a lot of books out there on any number of topics that anyone could be interested in. But the fact that, you know, I mean, I do consider myself extremely lucky. I happen to write this book at the right time and someone happened to be interested at the right time. So, yeah, I can't wait for that to come out. Yeah.Very happy that you did write this book. and I'm very happy that this is happeningcause I talk to people about the subject, you know, like norms per se. and they, they look at you sideways like what did they do, they do, but they're responsible for manson. but and it's like, oh my God, the rabbit hole so deep. I don't have enough battery in my flashlight to take you on this rabbit hole that's one of the things with M K U just in general, I mean, initially reading about this, my first impression is that obviously that that's like a.😊You know, conspiracy theory or it can't be right. But some conspiracies are true. And the M K ultratra stuff, they actually did this. They were dosing people using prostitutes behind a one way mirror. George White sitting on a toilet watching this happen theyre, you know, I mean.Even besides drugs, M K Ultra is involved in a lot of psychological experiments. So not just LSD. Most people associate M K Utra with LSD, but one of the.One of the most expansive of the sub projects is subpro 68. It was by this guy named you and Cameron. Have you heard that name before Okay, you and Cameron, He is a psychiatrist up in Montreal in Canada working at what's called the Allen Memorial Institute.And Gotlieb wanted to expand M K Utra besides drugs because he already had a lot of people doing drug experiments. So he wanted to see if there were psychological techniques that could be used to manipulate a person. So not just in an interrogation, but can we actually like, control a person's personality, Can we make them behave in certain ways, make them do something. So the idea that you and Cameron had come up with before the CIA is involved, I should mention you and Cameron is a behaviorist. So he thinks that all.。Behavior is a result of nurture, not nature. So it it's the environmental input that causes a person to behave a certain way. And he thought that if you could bring a person back down to a blank slate, remove all the environmental inputs that have been put into them. and then you can build them back up in your image into whatever you want them to be. So his idea to bring someone down to the blank slate was to induce enough stress that they forgot who they formerly were. And so you reduce them to the blank slate, and then the CIA is really interested in, if you could do that, then you could form them.To whatever. So you and Cameron, his main goal is to try to figure out what can induce enough stress on a person to bring them down to that blank.

And so he performs a lot of experiments. His most famous one is called psychic driving, where he was doing a.😊A therapy session quote unquote therapy with one of his patients. And she had, he was recording the session. And she said something about how, you know, my mother, when I was young, used to tell me, blah, bla, blah. you know, she said something negative to her. And so you and Cameron rewinded that on the tape that he was recording and made her listen back to it and said, hey, I want you to listen back to what your, you say your mother used to say to you when he rewinded the tape and played it forward as soon as the woman was kind of quoting her mother, and she listened to that herself on the tape. she recoiled And Cameron thought, oh, you have an.Negative reaction to that. So he rewinded again. And again, and again, and he kept rewinding it. And she just got more and more emotional. had this more and more kind of visceral reaction to what she was saying her mother used to tell her. So this LED Cameron to develop the concept of psychic driving, which is you record some kind of negative message. And then you make someone listen to it for thousands and thousands and thousands of times for weeks on end for hours every day. all their waking day. They basically are strapped into a headphone that is playing this negative message and it will break them down over time. That's how you.😊s have stress to break them down to the blank slate, and then you can record a positive psychic driving message to build them up into whatever image you want them to be.So that was his initial idea. Was it based on anything. Not really., It was just based on he had this one encounter with this woman, and she had a negative reaction. And he's just trying to induce stress. This obviously seemed to induce stress in her. Therefore, we're going start playing these negative tapes to them. So it was just his idea. It's just his idea. He, He was known for doing this kind of thing, like kind of spur the moment. In fact, there was one, There was one.Yeah.。Kid, basically, who had been at this Allen Memorial Institute where you and Cameron was, He eventually had gotten out, but he had tried to commit suicide. And so he was sent back to the Allen Memorial Institute. But the way that he had tried to commit suicide was to close the garage and have the CO2 build up with a running car and then he would, you breathe in and pass out and die. that ended up not working. However, when he went back to the Allan Memorial Institute, you and Cameron thought, you know, his personality seems like a little bit better than it was that when he was here before, maybe C2 can like.Someone and so he sent out some of his some of his assistants to go by like CO2 canisters. And we're gonna start like giving this to few. But it turns out the assistants knew that this was like completely unethical. There's no medical basis for anything. And so they lied to him and said,, the canisters were way more expensive than we could actually afford So we can't do that. But so he was, he was just, he was trying to find any way that he could have a breakthrough to cure mental illness. And he was using his patients as guinea pigs completeinea pig complete guinea pig. What was the result with the woman the woman where they played.NativeI don't Well there there are dozens and dozens of people who that happened to I don't know about her in particular because I don't know if she's actually named in the documents. So I don't know any of these experiments have a positive effect were hardly hardly hardly So was shouldn't say positive I should say were the effective No no for the most part, the people who he did his practice on came out way worse than when they went in. So psychic driving that's initially what got the CIA interested in camera.So it's important to keep in mind it's not that the CIA told Cameron to do this, he's doing this on his own because he thinks he's going to cure mental illness by having this radical breakthrough where we break them down and build them back up and we can build them back up and make them forget their schizophrenia or depression or whatever they have the CIA reads his article about psychic driving and they think this is the kind of thing we're interested in so from that point on they start funding him not only to do psychic driving experiments.But also, he does like puts people in chemical comaas for months on end, and while they're in these chemical coas, he would put an audio device next to their pillow playing these psychic driving messages.And he would put them in sensory deprivation chambers for weeks. You know, they would have goggles over their eyes, ear mus on their ears. They would have cardboard tubes over their arms so that they couldn't feel anything. And they would just be in a room for weeks on end. The idea, again, being to induce enough stress so that it breaks them down so that you can eventually build them up, but.One of the saddest stories in the book, really, is of this woman named Mary Morrow, who was one of the patients of you and Cameron in Montreal. The, the sad thing about her, especially is she had been a.Resident in training at the Alllen Memorial Institute under you and Cameron. So she had been training to be a doctor under him, and she had administered some of these techniques, including electric shock. So that's one of the things, too, we would put these electrodes on the heads of people and just he would continually shock them until, again, the idea was to reduce them to like, in one case, he says an infantile like state where they lose control of their bladder. They can't eat. They can't talk. They can't go to the bathroom on their own. They can't put on their own clothes or anything like that. So she was in charge of administering some of these. I mean, you know.Therapy sessions or whatever they would call it, but just basically torture to these people.She ended up having almost kind of a psychotic break herself. She, she became anorexic, and she failed her neurology exams. And so she went into a really deep depression. She attempted to commit suicide that didn't work. she was admitted to the hospital and to another hospital. You and Cameron came to visit her. And he said, I think you should come back to the Allen memorial, not as a doctor, but as a patient and let me treat you. So she ends up going back to the Allen memorial as a patient. And she thought to herself that it's going to be O there.going to do the electric shock to me because you had to sign a consent form and for that to happen to you know the people who are signing the consent forms, they don't know how bad it's actually going to be. They're just signing their name, but she knows I haven't signed a consent form so they can't do that to me. But it turns out in the time since she went to the hospital and came back, they had stopped doing the consent forms and he would just do this on whoever. And so they ended up doing this electric shock treatment treatment on her. And know afterwards, she would be babbling incontinent, couldn't put on her makeup or clothes or anything.Eventually, she would call her mother after some of these treatments, and her mother knew something was going on because she just became more and more incoherent as time went on.So the mother sent Mary's sister, Margaret, in order to go to the Allan Memorial to basically bus her out of there. So the sister walked in the front door and said, I'm not leaving until I see Mary. You know, I'm going to call the police if you don't let me through. So eventually, she goes to her sister's room.

The door. and Mary is sitting there just with wide bugeyes. You know, doesn't even recognize her sister. It takes several days for her to figure out where she actually is, And then she gets busted out of there. So it's very reversible in any way. was it.It's in her case, I'm not exactly sure she went on to have a little bit of a career, but she eventually attempted to commit suicide later again. That was unsuccessful. Then her and several of the victims of E and Cameron's experiments in the 1980s, they ended up suing the CIA for supporting E and Cameron. And during those lawsuits.Yeah.The attorneys who are representing them. They took the depositions of several of the people who were involved in M. K Ultra to try to use this during their trial. So they took the depositions of Siney Gotley, Robert Lashbrook, Richard Hems, the head of the CIA and many of the victims who are victims of all this. And that's basically the basis for my book. I found thousands of pages of these depositions. That's just verbatim transcript of these people talking about either what they did or what was done to them. And so I'm using that throughout the book to explain. Here's what they're doing in their own words or here's what was done to them in their own words.W, so what was the result of the trial, Oh, Well, so it was actually settled out of court before it went to trial. So the plaintiffs, the CIA gave the plaintiffs $750000 to be split among them. But you know, after attorney fees and everything, it doesn't really amount to muchnch anyway and so.Yeah.。You know, they said to Alacour, they got a little bit of money, but it never went to trial. And so these depositions, though, you know, since it never went to trial, these were just in the papers of Joseph Rao, who's the main lawyer who was involved in this case. And when he passed away his his papers were donated to the Library of Congress that had all these thousands of pages of depositions in there,823 pages of which are Siney Gotley testifying about what he did in Mke Utra. And so I was rooting around the Library of Congress and having to find them. So that's how I found basically the basis for what this book is.Wow,Wow, I wonder how much of that woman's psychological breakdown had to do with the guilt of performing those experiments on people and realizing that it wasn't doing anything. Yeah you thought you and Cameron thought I was gonna to do In fact it was destroying people's minds. Yeah, maybe some I mean it's just speculation because I'm not sure course that had to avoid on the consciences you know there's.In what was called the sleep room, you and Cameron's sleep room, This is where they would do the chemical comaas. The one of the nurses I have kind of her.Diary entries, basically describing what she was seeing. And she does seem to be pretty reluctant to have done what she was actually doing. And you and Cameron, she said would often come over to her and pat her on the back and say, you know, you're helping these people, You're helping these people, just trying to coax her along to go along with what he was telling her to do. You and Cameron seems like like a complete madman. Like was it almost like too good to be true. not too too good, but too, too like mad scientist to be true. Was he on any.Sort of drugs. I mean, I've never seen anything to indicate that he was on drugs, but he definitely had a almost like a messssiah complex. He thought I'm going to be the one to win the Nobel Prize in medicine because I'm going to cure all mental illness through this psychic driving or whatever it was. He was going to be the next Sigmund Freud. He really had delusions of grandeur. just like I think jolly West did as well. And so I think that drove a lot of what he was doing. His patients were just a means to his own end. they're the guinea pigs that I can use to prove that these medical techniques actually work. and.For everyone's going to praise me because I've cured you know schizophrenia or whatever it is I'm just always suspicious of something that has that someone has that kind of access to all sorts of compounds like and then you're experimenting on people and you know, especially with things like amphetamines which do tend to make people a little less empathetic and a little more driven you know I I would be very curious to see if he was interested in anything like that Yeah I don't remember specifically for him in that case I mean, many of,People who are either running the sub projects or approving them like Sydney Godlieb, Godtb took a lot of LSD. He, you know, he was when the CIA got LSD before it gave it to other people, the first thing they did was try it for themselves to see what actually happened. So Si Godlieb took it multiple times before he ever even gave it to people to understand what it was like.Wow, and, you know, one of the, the physician who was the attending physician the first time he took LSDcause they did it in kind of a controlled setting with several other people there.A guy named Harold Abramson. And for anyone listening who knows much about the Frank Olson incident, Frank Olson is a guy that would later be dosed with LSD. He would go out the hotel window in New York. And Harold Abramson is the guy who Si gottlieeb and Robert Lashbrook. They took to New York to get treatment from Harold Abramson afterwards. So he had the CIA connection.Wow, the reason why I brought up inphetamines is because I feel like.That might be one of the unheralded or undiscussed drivers in a lot of like psychopathic behavior that we see in our culture today, I think theres there's a lot of people on prescribed amhamphetamines that operate in a way that is very very much like functional metthhead, you know what I mean, and I would wonder like if you were in charge of doing something, this evil just.Running experiments where you're destroying people's minds and you're getting no positive results. None of its work. yet you continue to do it. and you even do it to people that used to be involved in the program with them poor woman like what.What's the psychological profile of that guy because he's obviously mentally ill, which is fascinating, right, It's fascinating that a mentally ill person is working on a mind experiment program because there's no ways not mentally ill, like to have no empathy to these people that you've tried all this stuff on. And not only has it not been effective and not rid them of mental illness, it's made them far worse. Yeah, yeah, for you and Cameron, I feel like he definitely lacked empathy. whether that's some kind of medically medical thing or whatever, there are a couple people in the book, I think.Like that one of them is you and Cameron, another is George White who is in charge of operationeration midnight climax, he was in it just for the fun of it, would he would dose his own friends with LSD just to see what would happen You know there's there's one story in the book There was a woman who had gone over to a dinner party base.

She had actually gone over with her husband a few weeks before, but George White didn't dose them because the husband was there. The husband went away on a business trip. So the woman and her friend, she they ended up going to see George White to hang out.And white doed them with LSD. The woman had her one year old son there with her, but he still dosed them with LSD. She ends up basically going crazy. I mean, she.You know, she goes home. She ends up calling, you know, George White, asking what's happened to me. what's going on. One of these women, she ended up being committed to a mental institution for basically the rest of her life after this happened to her. So she had some kind of like psychotic break after this unwitting, surptitious dose of LSD. Of course, she didn't know what was going on. So she thought her whole world was collapsing. Yeah, she, she lost her husband. It was said that she would cower in the corner of her parents, you know, house before she went to this mental institution, convinced that an un.ified they was like looking after her trying to get her, you know, calling on the phone. None of this was happening, but she was just having these delusions that someone was out to get her. That's kind of a recurring theme that you see in these people who are unwittingly dosed.One of them, one of the saddest stories in the book is a guy named Wayne Ritchie. And George White did the same thing to him.But Wayne Ritchie was this. He was a guard at Alcatraz for a while. This is in San Francisco. and he had gone to a Christmas party at the post office there in San Francisco. just for, you know, he was a US marshal, too. So just the US marshals, whatever. And that night.😊Yeah.He was drinking, you know, some of the punch at this party, and he started feeling very strange. He started seeing colors. The room started spinning around him. He ended up going upstairs to where his locker was and you know, getting his things. and he wound up going home because he didn't, you know, know what was going on. when he got home, his girlfriend was upset at him. She said that, you know, I'm not happy here, I want to move to New York. And so when he's in this fog. He decides, I know how to set my life on track. I'm going to grab a couple of my service revolver revolvers.I'm going to go to a bar downtown. I'm going rob it, and I'm going to give the money to my girlfriend so she can go to New York, and she'll be happy. And so she won't break up with me. So when he's in this fog, he ends up doing all this. He gets his revolvers. He goes to a bar downtown.😊He, you know, basically has a stick up. Give me all the money in the till. A quick thinking patron who's sitting next to him, basically gets the mug of beer and smashes it over his head. So he falls down. The cops come later. They arrest him. He's in jail. After a day or two, He kind of sobers up and kind of awakens from this fog. And he doesn't know what happened to him. at that point, He ends up losing his job losing his friends for the next 30,40 years, He doesn't know what happened. until in 1999. He was reading the Washington Post. and he saw.Article describing M Ca ultratra and two things in particular stuck out to him. One was George White, whom he knew back in the days when he was a US marial Marshal, and the other one was a description of LSD. And so Wayne Richitchie starts putting all this together and thinking, I think George White gave me LSD that night at the holiday, you know party and spike the punch bowl. And that's what happened. And it turns out.😊Yeah.You can see in this book in the in the photo section, the last photo in the photo section of my book. It's a image of George White's diary from the day that Wayne Richitchie went insane. And it says federal building Christmas party. So he was there at the Christmas party.😊Wow!Imag being that guy reading that article 30 years later, realizing this guy ruined my life for fun. Yeah so he ended up suing the CIA, but the judge said that he couldn't prove that he had been dosed with drugs so they couldn't rule in his favor and so that was it Jesus.Yeah, but there are, I mean, there are dozens of stories a fucking psycho. What a fucking psycho. he's dosing up the punch bowl, ruining lives. and, and he knows how.Messed up, It is because by that point, he had done this to multiple people and called them and caused them to, to lose a lot. You know, So he knew what he was doing at that point. God,, that this is just what happens with people when they have that kind of unchecked power and no oversight.系。Yeah, and their, the kind of psychopath that would be involved in this sort of experimentation in the first place. Yeah, yeah, no, so, so I think he's probably the most heinous of the individuals in this book. All of them are, to a degree, Si Gotlieb.Yeah.I think he, I don't think he's as heinous in the sense that he's like intentionally trying to harm people. He thinks he's doing this for a patriotic reason. He thinks M. K Utra is actually going to help us defend ourselves against the Soviet Union. There is some like moral justification, at least he has for himself. So it's not all just, you know, whatever George White is doing. But at the same time.Sydney got Lib.Doesn't really take any responsibility for what happens to these people. Basically the way that M. K Ultra was structured with these sub projects. Siney Gottley wasn't running these experiments himself. What he would do is he would fund other people to do experiments. And most of the time, these people were experts in their own field. So they were like reputable people. You and Cameron was the head of the American Psychiatric Association. The Canadian Psychiatric Association. And the World Psychiatric Association. He was like the most famous psychiatrist in the world. and he was being funded by this,.Sydney Gotlef thought, well, if I can fund reputable psychiatrists or drug researchers to do these experiments, then it's up to them to provide the safety and the procedures, you know to keep these patients safe, It's not my job, they're the ones who are conducting the experiments, that's how he justified it to himself but that's how the structure of MK Utra typically worked such a diffusion of responsibility exactly Gottlieb is funding people and he's not even funding them directly in most cases what's happening is he's using cutout organizations So he's giving the money to course.One of thems called the Getchker Fund, one of thems called the National Institutes of Mental Health, and then the CIA sets up its own cutout organization called the Society for theInvestigation of Human Ecology, which it's just a made-up organization but the CIA would transfer the funds to the society who would then transfer it to the researcher in many cases the researchers didn't even know they were being funded by the CIA, they just thought, oh, I got a grant from this.

That's great. So they don't even know that their true patron is Sid Gotle Ben M K Utra. They just know, oh, they want me to do these experiments. and in many cases they're allowed to still publish their work. know so you know they're publishing this. Nothing's changed that much from what they were doing before. But it turns out their patron is actually the CIA who wants to make sure they continue doing these experiments just in case they find something that could be of use. Oh my God. What was your journey personally like both researching these subjects and and then writing books.😊About it, because what would what was your opinion on all these things before this and how much of it how much of it has shaped your worldview so with the.Probably the first book is more formative to the shaping of my worldview just because, you know, that was the first one I did. So what what was your perspective before getting involved in any of this material, Well, I'm pretty much I would consider myself a skeptic generally, you know, so when stuff gets a little too outlandish. I am pretty skeptical. but of course that.。The existence of M. K Ultra and even in my first book, the Jo tricks Department, there are some, there are some projects that are even more outlandish than some of the stuff I've been talking about with M K Ul. And so that kind of lowered my barriers to thinking that, oh, people are crazy here like, oh, the the government does actually perform these crazy, you know, projects. one of the one of the ones that really lowered my barriers to that for the first book was called Operation Fantassia.😊Yeah.And again, is just a testament to the absurdity of some of the ideas that were happening in World War I and with just within the intelligence community, Operation Fantassia was the brainchild of this guy named Ed Salllinger. And he had been a businessman who had done imports and exports with Tokyo in Tokyo. So he knew Japanese culture. He knew the language. He knew the religious beliefs. The O S S wanted to exploit that by trying to find a way We can.。We can demoralize the Japanese. You know a lot about the Japanese psyche. The idea was at Salinger. So figure out a way we can demoralize the Japanese and make them basically give up this war because, you know, they're dug in they're not giving up. We need to find a way that we can basically use psychological warfare on them. So his idea is that in the Shinto religion. There are these kind of mystical figures called Kitsuni. And in many cases, they take the form of like a fox, a glowing fox..And oftentimes, they represent portents of doom. So, you know, if you see one of these Kitsuni, it's an indication that something bad is about to happen. And so Salinger knew, what if we can artificially create Kitsi, spread them around Japan, Then all these Japanese soldiers are going to see them and think, oh, that's a portent of doom. Surely, it means we're going to lose the war. Therefore, we might as well lay down down our arms right now. And so Salinger, initially his idea is we're going to create whistles that can make fox sounds. And we're going to distribute them across Japan to our agents there, and they can blow these whistles like.Anyone would recognize a fox sound., He had the idea that we're going to create artificial fox odors and spread it around places. And people are going to think that it's the Kitsi foxes that are walking around. None of those ever materialized. But then he thought, what if we actually do it, What if we capture foxes from China and Australia, We paint them with glowing radioactive paint. And then we and then we drop them in Japan.哈哈.。Surely that's gonna to scare the Japaneses. So there are actually several experiments. Oh my God. they did this. So they captured foxes. The United States Radium Corporation produced a paint with radium radioactive. But so loom from like exactly aisle of watch. exactlyactly, It's the same kind of thing. them. So they decided we're gonna paint foxes with this. But they first needed to test whether it's possible to paint fur with this and it stay on. So they went to the Central Park zoo. And they got a raccoon, and they painted it and kept it under lock and key. And it turns out after a few days of.Ordinary raccoon shenanigans. The paint stayed on. So they thought, okay, this might have something going for it. So then Salinger decided we're going to paint these foxes, row them out into the middle of the Chesapeake Bay and throw them overboard to see if they can actually swim to shore. because if we're going to get these foxes to Japan, we're going to have to throw them off the coast and they're going to have to swim and then scare people. But can foxes even swim. He didn't know. So he gets these foxes.😊。He paints them with this paint. He throws them in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay. And it turns out they actually swam ashore. So that worked. However, by the time they had gone as shore, the paint had all washed off. And so, so it's like, if you' were to do this in Japan. The paint you see a fox. It's not a ksuni It has to be a glowing fox. And so he decided, well, that's not going to work. So his next plan., this is one of the craziest things I found from my first book. The next plan was, we are going to stuff a fox, a dead fox. just taxidermy yet. Have this.B we're going paint it with his glowing paint. We can drape a cloth over it and paint glowing bones on it to make it look like a skeleton. And we're going to put a human skull over this fox head to make it look as if it's a human skull because apparently, this was like an even more potent version of the Kitsuni myth that was going around in Japan. So we're going to put this human skull on this tax and every glowing fox. And we're going have the jaw open and close as if it's talking. And we're going to blast propaganda out of the skull. And we're going attach balloons to it so that it can fly over Japan.😊Japanese are going to look up and see this flying glowing radioactive fox spreading this propaganda and they're apparently going to lay down their arms I guess that was the plan and so that was his his ultimate idea of what we can do to that attempt that never actually made it about the time that he was writing all this up and doing these experiments the Manhattan Project had performed the Trinity test and so it was like well we already have the weapon that's going to win the war so we don't need the glowing foxes Thank you very muchow Do you know about the three tees of things.Giving turkey for eating table for gathering and touchdowns for winning with draft King sportsbook an official sports betting partner of the NFL every touchdown could bring you closer to cashing in before dessert with draft King sportsbook all the actions in your hands first touchdown anytime td live bets every play every snap every game counts big plays, bold calls and bragging rights when the games get good the bets get better and here's the best part new customers.You can bet just five bucks and if your bet wins, you'll get $200.

So when you're having conversations with people, like, I've always been conspiratorly minded but more in the fun side like Bigfoot UFO's dumb stuff as a distraction. Like I know what it is, I I'm interestedca it's silly, you know, and I just find it fun, like the bigfoot thing is I watched a Bigfoot documentary the other night against.😊My own better judgment and now my YouTube algorithm is filled with bigfoot stories, it's just the dumbest thing ever, but yeah.When I started doing the podcast, it slowly shifted my perspective of not only are there real conspiracies, but they're way more prevalent than you would ever think, and you you almost have to get lucky to find out about them, you know, like one of the things from the bookChaos was Tomm O'Neill describing some of the documents that were discovered in God I believe it was a storage unit.Yeah.That where they they had like the M ultratra Yeah Oh yeah, yeah that's a big part of my book. So in 1975 or so, really in 1974, theres something called the Rockefeller commission and that was an executive commission set up to investigate past abuses of the In community and that kind of led to the church committee in 1975 and and also the Pike committee in the House. but after they published their final reports, those reports included things about M.alltra that the US government had performed these secret drug experiments in the past, and that led a former State Department employee named John Marx to file a Freedom of Information Act request, basically for any and all documents related to these former drug experiments and so you know, not too long afterwards,This the a CIA.This guy named Frank Labeer. was working in like the CIA archives, but he discovered these six or7 boxes of material that Sydney Gotlieb hadn't destroyed when he retired from the CIA, because Gottlieb incinerated most of his files. And so did Richard Helms they were in on this together. But it turns out those boxes escape the destruction because they had been sent to the CIA record center several years before Got and Hems retired. Therefore, they weren't incinerated in this purge, And so they survived. So Marx filed that information request these.We found, and then they were released.This was right around the time that there were a couple of subcommittee hearings on MK Utra. and that's right when all these documents came out too. So it became kind of a big deal. But so that's how thousands and thousands of documents have related to Mk Utra survived, even though Gotle Ben Helms incinerated most of the files that they actually had, which leads you to consider what would we' know if those documents hadn't been discovered., we would be decades behind on this. Yeah, they do reveal a lot of information.That said, we can actually kind of run this scenario because we do know what we kind of knew before those documents were released. So before those documents were released, you still had the Rockefeller Commission in the church committee and a few other things. but so we would have known still because it came out before those documents about the Frank Olson incident, this guy was dosed with LSD at this place called Deep Creek and he ended up going out the window of the stateler Hotel in New York, he died. we would have known about Operation midnight climax, even though I don't know if that name was specifically used within.These committee publications. So we would have known a great name. Well, that's George White's doing. Siney Gotb said he had a flare with a pin like he, he was a journalist before he Yeah, yeah, he was. In fact, while we're on that topic, at the end of Operation midnight climax, he wrote a letter to Sydney Gotlieb.😊Basically, thanking him for supporting me for all these years out of all the M K Utra sub projectss, you know, a lot of them started in 1953. many of them were done by 1963, but several continued into the late 60s.But he, after this was done, he wrote a letter to Siney Gotlieb. and in the depositions that I found, the attorneys confront Gotlieb about this. And they ask him what was in that letter. And Gotlieb says, oh, you know, he, he had a flare for riding. You can't trust anything. He said, but No, whooe was' int it, Turns out what was in it. George White wrote, I toiled in the vineyards wholehetedly because it was fun, fun, fun. Where else could a red blooded American boy. lie, Che, steel, rape and pillage with a sanction and blessing of the all highest.😊He wrote that down.Good yes. So we, we, we, we would have known about the Frank Olson incident. We would have known about Operation Manac climax, though maybe not that name. We would have known the broad outlines of M K Ultra because that was already lease released before those files, But the files give us a really detailed view of what happened, but.Yeah.We don't know what was in the files that were incinerated. That's correct. You imagine that. Yeah, we we'd kind of do know a little bit about what was in them because there was an investigation that was done afterwards because it was illegal for them to destroy these files, not that anything ever happened to them. They didn't face any consequences for it. However, Golieb's secretary. This woman who had only been working for for him for a few weeks before he retired. He told her to basically incinerate these files. You know, to help him do this. So she didn't know it was against protocol or whatever. She was new to them.Job, but she was interviewed later as part of a CIA investigation into the destruction.

And she does say a little bit about what she thinks were in the files. She says it was some of his personal papers. And there was secret and secret sensitive files in there. We don't have really have a great idea about what it could be. although I do think a lot of the files were.。In the depositions that I found, George White, or Siney Gotlieb says that George White would write to him personal updates about the experiments that he was doing in these, know brothels, basically. And so I'm assuming that a lot of those files consisted of George White's personal reports on what was going on.Now, when you get deeper and deeper into this stuff, how much has it shaped your worldview, a decent amount in the sense that just as it did for.Kind of the American public in general in the 1970s, when this was coming out, it really LED people to cast a sical eye toward the government in thinking.It's just assumed that the government is supposed to be the protector of civil liberties. But after Watergate after Mke ultratra, after the Vietnam War, it starts to seem as if the government is infringing on those civil liberties. you know, instead of being the protector of it. in many cases, it's infringing on them. not that it doesn't protect civil liberties, but.嗯。One of the main things that I came away after writing this book is the problem of oversight. You know, I think the the constitutional system of government that we have is ingenious. The fact that we have checks and balances and these the separation of powers. However, you have to enable the separate.。Branches of government to be able to check the other branches for most of the Cold War, that external check on the executive branch, the like Congress checking the executive, the president or the CIA didn't really exist. So any time that the CIA was doing an operation.。Have a chapter about this. But, you know, sometimes CIA personnel would try to inform members of Congress of what they were doing. I have one specific quote where a CIA guy walks up to a sitting senator and says, hey, let me tell you about what we're doing in Chile or whatever it is. And then he says, no, I don't want to hear it. Don't tell me. Just do what you're going to do, He doesn't even want to know. So it's like, how can you expect Congress to give oversight of the executive. if they are completely unwilling to even know what the executive is doing. So fortunately, in the aftermath of these revelations. There have been some.Some.Programs or committees that are set up within Congress to provide that external check. However, it's, you know, it's not even clear how effective those are for one one check on the executive after this is that.The president now has to.Sign off basically on covert operations so that that eliminates the president's plausible deniability. One of the main themes throughout this book is is what I call this the vicious cycle of secrecy. So an organization like the CIA that has secrecy. that kind of leads to what I see is this vicious cycle. secrecy leads to plausible deniability because if it's secret, nobody can know that I'm doing this. Therefore, I'm not going to be blamed for it. So secrecy leads to plausible deniability. plausible deniability leads to reckless behavior like.K ultratra, if nobody's going to find out what I'm doing, Therefore, I'm incentivized to do some crazy stuff because I'm not going to be held accountable for it. So secrecy to plausible deniability, plausible deniability to reckless behavior, reckless behavior in many instances leads to embarrassment. It's almost inevitable for many of these projects that they get found out Someone leaked something to the press. This is how the family jewels that the CIA had that was like a compilation of all the illegal stuff that it had done over the past couple of decades. It eventually got leaked to seymour Hish.ublished on the front page of the New York Times. So reckless behavior leads to embarrassment, but embarrassment leads to secrecy, because now that we've been found out, we've got to make sure that never happens again, we need more secrecy And the vicious cycle continues. So if you can break that vicious cycle by having some kind of external check, that's what you actually need, like an empowered Congress that is willing to check the executive. And then you realize.😊Yeah.Well, who's running against them, Who wants that job, Not a lot of impressive people, A lot of really driven, successful, intelligent people are involved in other activities that consume their time. They have families. They have careers. They have a lot. They don't have the desire to be a congressperson. So you're not getting the cream of the crop. You're not even getting anything remotely similar to the cream of the crop. You're occasionally getting great people that really want to serve.The country, But that is rare. that is, that is like, I wouldn't say rare. But if 20% of the food you ate at a place was poison, would you go eat at that place, you would not, right, You would say I'm assuming there's fucking poison in that place. That's Congress. Yeah, you know, that elected officials. Yeah, and Andrew Yang has made this point before. I know I've heard him say it that the.。The reelection rate of Congress is super high. It's like 80,90%, whatever it is. The approval rating for Congress is like in the teens. So how is it we have such a divergence between the reelection rate in the approval rating, it has to do with the kind of electoral system, know the people who are incentivized to actually run for Congress, in many cases, they're the most ideological on either side because the only race that matters is actually the primary because if you're in you know a district that is 90% Trump voters, the Republican is going to win.The general election, it doesn't matter who it is. So, you know the prim is the main election that happens in those districts. And if that's the case, well, the person who can win the primary is going to win the general and who's going to win the primary Well, it's going to win it's going to be the person who can get 90% of Trump voters to be more interested in them than whoever the other Republican you know, is in many cases that drives ideological extremism because you know, you're you're already selecting a sample size of voters within the primary who are.The most ideological extreme. And so they're going to elect basically whoever it is., because the general elections of foregone conclusion. So if you can realign the electoral system in a way to where.Yeah, I mean, I don't know the answer to this, but it would be some kind of open primaries or ranked voting or proportionport.

Ppresentation, ending gerrymandering, something like that then you better incentivize congresspeople to actually want the job or incentivize people who would be good at the job to engage in the job or to become congresspeople because they actually have a clear path to doing it because they're not going to be blocked in the primary So some kind of reform like that, I think is how you better facilitate this check between the different branches. but even then I don't know if it motivates the cream of the crop.Yeah.Ca I just I think most people would rather be on the outside, like most wealthy people that are successful. they'd rather fund a candidate that, you know, suits their needs., won't getting maybe big money out of politics that would be wonderful. that would be I mean, that would be the single probably biggest help and then also getting out insider trading out of Congress make it less like when you're finding out that people are getting 170,000 a year and they're worth hundreds of millions of dollars and there's no investigation.What, Like what did you do, What did you do and why are you still working, if you're so good at trading, Why are you working for 1 and70000 a year, which is a great salary, Don't get me wrong. I'd take it nothing wrong with $170000 a year. But when you have 400 million. Like you couldn't get me to do a job for 170000 a year. like I don't have the time. You couldnt get me to right, But you know what I'm saying like you can get Congress peopleople to still show up and do that job. Is it because they care that much about the American people. Well, that doesn't.Really jive. It doesn't make sense because they seem completely full of shit when they give their speeches. And they, it's all canned and fake and insincere. And there's no,, you don't have any real connection with their words. So what are they, they're, they're these weird people that have accepted this job that no one wants. It's critically important to the function of our government. And you're getting really.Yeah.Doll people that are taking this job. It's fascinating. One of the things that also was like so disheartening. I had Re Luna on the podcast who was great. And she's very interesting. And we mostly we're talking about Ufos because that's the thing that she's involved in but one of the things she said about certain issues is they don't want to solve these issues because this is how they run they can fundraise off Yeah exactly. And I was like oh no, like just that.Trap, I was like, oh I didn't want to think that that is the case. And she's like, oh, that's it. That's 100%. Yeah, they don't want to fix it. I mean, that makes me even more convinced, though, that a restructuring of the electoral system in a way that you know, eliminates I don't know. that incentivizes basically better behavior, whether that's through open primaries, rank choice voting, whatever that has to help in some way, I would think. So this should also be some sort of a competency test. If someone wants to take that.Poition like if you want to be a lawyer, you have to look at poor Kim Kardashian, and she can't pass the bar. and she's trying so hard. She keep can't pass the bar. It's hard. hard to be a lawyer. I'm kind of skeptical of a competency test in a sense, though, because someone has to write the test Well not not only that, but are you watching them. Do they use Chad G. And we're living in a weird world right now. You know, it's, it's a very weird world of technology.。You know, but it would be nice if you knew that this person was capable of doing the job., I mean, I bring it back to the passing the bar thing because, you know, law is very complicated. One of the things that I found out really recently that is super disturbing was that you don't have to be a lawyer to be a judge to be a judge interesting, Oh, if you, you don't have to know anything elected if you could just become a judge. you could be a regular person and just now you're a judge., I wonder what kind of judge that is it because I know some judge.Yeah, man, I don't give a fuck if it's a judge at dairy Queen likesh.What are you talking about you don't, you don't have to be a lawyer to be a judge. That's insane. That's so insane that's like you don't know how to count to be a mathematician Like what are you talking about You're a judge. you don't have to be a lawyer to be a judge to me was like, oh my God, state and federal courts. Most state and federal court in all federal judges must have a law degree some state practice requirements many states require judges to have a.number of years of experience as a practicing lawyer before theyre eligible for a judgeship makes sense when a law degree may not be required. limited court jurisdiction some states allow nonlawyers to become judges in specific lower level courts such as those that handle small claims, traffic violations or minor criminal matters state and local variations. the specific requirements may vary wildly by state, even by the type of court within a state and training judges appointed from the nonlawyer pool typically must compete complete.P ciific training programs, right, But what is the program, I wonder if that's a relic of.Like rural communities where maybe there isn't a lawyer, but you need someone to act in that position, you know, like like doctors have sheriff in this. Yeah, instead of being a like an M D doctor, some people can practice medicine, you know, in rural communities they do without being a M D doctor. I forget the term of it. but okay, whatever, whatever that term is. So maybe maybe they don't have a doctor. Well, yeah, they don't have a doctor, but you can, you can, you still have a degree, not an M D, but some kind of medical degree.that maybe doesn't require as much time or you didn't complete your resume. So maybe, maybe it's a relic of, of that I right, that makes sense. But, but point being that.You know, if Congress has oversight over these things, well, who are we talking about?This is the thing like if you are the CIA and you are running some program that you think is crucial to national security and you have some fucking dangling from pickcca state, Virginia, North Dakota, whatever some ding dong that just happened to be able to get the right amount of votes because they have the right color on their flag you know and then all of a sudden they're in and you have to talk to this fucking morron like get out of here like I'm not telling you shit you're gonna hold back.Information you're going to come.

Re why you have toact files fuck off you'll be gone in two years this is the inherent tension within any intelligence community, whether it's the CIA or the FBI. there are legitimate reasons to keep things secret. You have to keep secret00% But at the same time, the fact that you're afforded that secrecy allows you to avoid accountability100% it's a catch 22 You have to keep secrets. There's just no way around it. But at the same time, how can I know that the secrets they're keeping is because it's in my interest or it's because it's in their interest.100%. and then you find out the really crazy stuff that's happened in the past like.Like the demean Arkansas cocaine situation, I haven't heard that you didn't you't know about the Barry Seals story. they made a movie about it with Tom Cruz, In fact, in the movie, Tom Cruz actually gets arrested for smuggling cocaine and Bill Clinton gets him off they call Bill Clinton he gets arrested in Arkansas. they call Bill Clinton and they have him dead to rights you know he's joking around with the copbs saying I'd like to buy you guys all Cadillacs and stuff like that and you're going to jail for the rest.He goes no, she's going to get a phone call and I'm going to walk right out of here and it turned out to be exactly how it happened Barry Seal was flying drugs from South America and dropping them off in meana, Arkansas and then they would go and pick them up in the woods they had a drop point.Yeah.Two kids were hang out in the woods, and they witnessed it accidentally. They were murdered. and then, the official story was they had done drugs and they laid down, fell asleep on train tracks. the parents.あ。Funded an autopsy and the autopsy show that they've been stabbed multiple times. so then there's an investigation comes through and then it turns out that there is a long history of this guy Barry Seels, who was CIA operative who was flying in cocaine dropping it off in me in Arkansas all known about by the Clintons everybody was aware of it and he had been funneling this money and they were using it, probably for black ops similar to what they did with the Contras in Sandinista.You know, the the the contrast versus the Sandistas in Nicaragua, he winds up.Going to testify gets murdered on his way to the trial with George Bush's phone number in his pocket. The whole story is like completely crazy. Oh yeah, When did that happen, I hadn't heard of.So it was when Bill Clintonin was a governor so I believe it was the 80s86 Yeah you weren't alive then that's hilarious fucking crazy story but this is the CIA right when this is the same thing that they did I'm friends with freeway Ricky Ross, do you know who he is okay great story so.Yeah.Rick Ross the rapper. Okay, you know who that he is. He got his name from a very famous street hustler named Freeway Ricky Rick Ross, His real name is Rick Ross. He's the real Rick Ross. Rick Ross was a guy who is a tennis player, a young tennis player who started selling cocaine. It was like super disciplined because he was a tennis player So was funneling millions of dollars a cocaine.D had no idea he was getting his cocaine from the CIA.So he was getting cocaine, selling it in the hood. They were getting the money, and they were using it this Oliver North thing with the Contras versus Sandinistas. All of this comes out in court and he winds up going to jail. He winds up going to jail for selling the cocaine, doesn't know how to read. He's illiterate, learns how to read in jail, becomes a lawyer in jail. goes over his trial and realizes that they had tried him on the three strikes law, which is.supposed to be three different felonies at three different times, but they jammed him all together. And so he gets off so he's free now and he sells legal marijuana in California. he's been on the podcast multiple times. but this was the CIA that was involved in all of this is this is how like they were making money, they were selling cocaine And one thing crazy just about not only that, but M Ultra in general, it's against the CIAs charter to operate within the United States you know that should be.a deal into right there for whatever they're doing within the United it's just's within it's against the charter. I mean, there's no more discussion. that's illegal. Well I just think without oversight, there's cowboys And there's also when you realize how much money is there to be made and that you could this funnel this money into oversee accounts that are anonymous and then you could eventually retire someday and get out of the game and be worth millions of dollars and live in Monaco or whatever the fuck you want to do like.That's a dream for a lot of these guys I think they get involved, they realize it's a completely corrupt system and it's corrupt from the top down and there's ways to make money and there's a bunch of stuff going on where money's being funneled into these NGOs and there's just so much opportunity for corruption and so little oversight and so much power and so much secrecy and as you were talking about importance in the necessity of secrecy for national security, which is a real thing but also leads to corruption and it leads,To people just doing wild things because there's no one watching and they're in control, they're in they're look it's so it must be so fun like what's his name was talking about, the evil guy, George White, like he was talking about like like how much fun he had, which is so sick, but that's the kind of people that want that kind of a job and if you make that kind of a job available with no oversight.Yeah.We need like a council of elders, like a wise council, you know, like of like completely objective, brilliant people that oversee all these things that aren't ideologically captured. You know, they're financially independent. they don't need anything from you. I've mentioned external oversight, like Congress checking the executive, But at the same time, one of the big problems with M K Utra are one of the problems that LED to M K Ultra without people even within the CIA questioning it. There are people in the CIA who know about it, actually not that many because it's very heavily compartmentalized.

Some people still do know about it. So one of the questions I was asking myself throughout this book.Why aren't the people who are in the CIA and know about M K Ultra, Why aren't they speaking up, Why don't they say pulled Siney gott leave aside and just have a conversation with them, Do you think what you're doing here is, all right, I think they're terrified about their career. That's exactly the thing. There's a specific person within the CIA during this time. That's his job. The inspector general, So the inspector general within the CIA, His job is to make sure there's nothing that goes against the CIA's charter or internal regulations or the US law.。But I found an interview that he did later. There's this guy named Lyman Kirkpat. He was the inspector general during the 1950s when this was going on, and he did an investigation into M. K Utra in 1957 as it was going on. And it continued on after that. And so one of the things he talks about is, why isn't the case that you tried, Why didn't you try to shut this down. Like, you obviously knew this was illegal. In fact.Yeah.In 1963, a different CIA inspector general named John Erman. He did a separate investigation into M. K Ultra in his report, his report that I quote in this book specifically says, what I think they're doing is illegal and unethical. Those are his terms. and he's the inspector general. Yet in this later interview, Lyman Kirkpatrick talks about why, why didn't you tell them to stop. Why didn't you put an end to this, Why didn't you raise this to higher up, Why didn't you do something, And he said, I was worried about bringing up anything that could cause me to lose my job, He knew that if he brought this.Up, he'd basically be retaliated against. And so that was it. So, even, you know, there's problems with external oversight, but also internal oversight. The internal oversight has to be able to bring that kind of stuff up. And another lack of internal oversight is the fact that Si Gotlieb and Richard Helms They could destroy all these files with no repercussions. Its just completely illegal. It's against the Ca's own internal regulations.In fact, in these depositions that I found, some of the most.Colorful parts of the depositions happen with the lawyers. The lawyers just get into heated arguments back and forth. That makes the book really colorful. At certain times, you know, Joseph Rao is this old civil rights, you know, he used to be the civil rights lawyer. He He took on this case, basically to fight against the CIA at certain points, he basically says to the other lawyers representing the CIA. I'm gonna to punch you in the nose. and he says, I'm never giving this up. I'm going to mortgage my house. If it means I have to keep on fighting you. But there's a certain point where he basically lays into.Leb asking him, why did you destroy the files, Why did you destroy the files. Siney Gotlieb comes up with several excuses. One of those excuses at first is he says the CIA was drowning in paper. We had so much favor. We couldn't move. So there was just an internal kind of drive to get rid of this paper so that we could walk around and figure out where stuff was, he's just completely making this up Ro presses him again, why did you destroy this stuff. Si gott, you know, and he does this to Richard Hems too. They both eventually say again. Well, we wanted, you know, it's, it's part of.Our jobb to protect sources and methods. And so we wanted to make sure that nobody would be able to know what our sources and methods were as part of this project. So we had to destroy the files. And Rao was like, these files are secret. It's not like they're going to be released to the public. They're the CIA's files. How could how could destroying them protect sources and methods any more than just not releasing them to the public. Then it's just a non excuse. So eventually, Rao press has got leave more. And he kind of breaks down during this interrogation.And he says, I was embarrassed by it. I was embarrassed by what I had done, basically.You know, ruin the lives of all these people spent $10 million at all these different institutions for what for to ruin these lives. And we didn't even learn that much out of it. And so he destroyed the files. So and didn't face any repercussions. So in addition to external oversight, there's got to be some internal oversight that can provide a check and prevent that from happening. or if it does happen, at least.。At least deter others from doing the same thing by holding them accountable. It's really fascinating that what we're experiencing is essentially 250 years after the founding fathers had already recognized these patterns of human behavior. They required oversight. They required checks and balances in order to have a government that doesn't sink into tyranny. You have to have all these things in place to make sure that no one person has the power to do anything that really fucks up the apple cart. and they knew that.And they really painstakingly structured this system of government that they thought would protect against it, just they didn't factor into account special interest groups and the stock market and money, and they just didn't factor into it expanded exponentially into so many different factions so many different influencing bodies that it's almost completely out of control.Essentially, they knew what could happen that has proven to be accurate, which is really kind of fascinating. It is. It is. you know, it's a.It's a brilliant system. And I quote James Madison, actually, when I talk about oversight, because his specific verbiages, you know, auxiliary cautions are auxiliary precautions. You know, humans, he says men, men aren't angels. Therefore, auxiliary precautions are necessary to keep their ambitions in check, which means external oversight, which is like, he's exactly right. That's exactly what you need. He's exactly right, you know.😊は。I wonder like where this goes because it's going in the wrong direction from the founding fathers to today, it's going in the wrong direction. It's like I think most people agree that a lack of oversight and secrecy is a gigantic problem with not just not just the stuff that we've already discussed with M K Utra and the CIA and the cocaine and all these different things. but with virtually everything that gets decided upon in our government that affects daily lives of people. there's.There's so many different influences that aren't based on the greater good of the American people. It's based on financial interests. and that's sort of overwhelmed all of our policies, overwhelmed all of our systems of government And then you have all these social issues that they never really want to fix because they campaign fun against them which is what we' were talking about before. So this is this constant psychological game, There's a game of.

there's a game of certain key points, whether it is abortion or gun rights or immigration or whatever it is nothing ever gets solved. these are the beach balls that they throw up in the air at the concert and they keep getting bounced around and we're just a little dumb monkeys that are giving up our tax dollars so they can keep running this giant ponzi scheme I will say a counterintuitive point that I think is important to also make though is Daniel Sho was a CB.News correspondent and he's the guy who initially broke the story on CIA assassination tips on foreign leaders and he has this quote about how the US has a, you know there's a pendulum that swings between security and liberty you know the more security you have the less the more liberty basically you have to take away you can be infinitely secure but that means that the government would be inside your house and know everything about you and prevent you from doing anything but nothing bad would happen at least you wouldn't be able to do anything bad because there would be a policeman and,Beedroom basically on the opposite side, you know, if the pendulum swings too far the opposite way, complete liberty, well you have no security because anyone could do anything. So there's this this constant tension between security and liberty that swings throughout American history.And an important thing to keep in mind is that I don't think you want that pendulum to stop. You actually want a little bit of tension between that. You want.In other words, you want the press in Congress to be exposing abuses, you know, because.Human nature is not going to change. People are going to try to abuse the system and whatever it is. That's not going to stop. However, if the press and Congress aren't exposing these abuses, you might think that there are no abuses happening, but they're going to be happening. So I think it's actually good. the fact that this pendulum is swinging a little bit. the fact that there is a little bit of tension in the fact that there are being abuses being exposed. I wish the abuses didn't happen. But at the same time, the abuses are going to happen no matter what, therefore, the exposure.of the abuses is a good sign. It's a sign that the system is actually working as intended because the abuses are being exposed know one of the points I make in this book is dread the day when the press sings nothing but the praises of those in power and Congress says that there are no abuses to investigate it might seem like that's utopia but that's the day that you have lost all of your liberties that's a very good point that's a very good point and well said I think this is what we're seeing now with independent journalists.and that that these a lot of these issues that get raised are coming from independent journalists first, and then they ultimately have to be recognized when they reach the zeitgeist, they ultimately have to be recognized by the New York Times or by mainstream media publications, but they're not the ones who break a lot of these stories a lot of these stories are broken by the Glen Green Walls and the Matt Taibes and the genuine independent journalists who initially worked for an organization and then found there's some sort of,ideological blockade or some certain subjects that they couldn't breach or certain things that they were told that they couldn't publish and they were like I'm out and then they started doing it on their own and then also social media this is the new function that social media has where you have these accounts that break news stories all the time and interestingly enough some of them are very reliable and those ones wind up becoming the ones that people share and they get a tremendous amount of followers and then they are more.More trustworthy.Oftentimes then corporate media, which is really kind of scary but also fascinating like there's a need for it, there's a recognition, there's a distribution of information that lets you to see see all of this corruption and all of this chaos and like what's at the root of it and why isn't this being discussed in the New York Times and then all of a sudden someone puts up this 10 Twitter post of all these different links and shows you this is the history of the story of and then a month later it's in the Washington Post?And and it's interesting, it's interesting, it'sca it's like, it's almost like these, this need exists. It's not being fulfilled by mainstream mediacause mainstream media is captured by corporate interests. So in order to have this information comes out.あ。The world gives us this new platform. and that's social media. and social media distributes all this stuff. And then you have to sort through what's real.'s foreign governments making up story. That's the other side of it. because the algorithm can push something. but it doesn't necessarily push truth It might just push engagement. And if that's the case. then how do you know community notes yeah yeah, something like that. I mean, Well, that's the beautiful thing about Twitter. And when Elon solved that issue with community I don't necessarily say solved. It's not solved. But.It' certainly made it a lot easier to understand what's going on like because there's oftentimes there's some outrageous video clip like oh my God, can you believe the Democrats are doing this and then it turns out no that's actually from a movie you know or that's actually AI or that's actually from 2016 and it's in Poland or you know I mean there's a lot of that stuff happens where people get outraged and someone posts something and then I always go to the original account that posts it and.Yeah.How many times I've gone there I'm go oh you're not a real person like most of the time I go and look at all the posts that they have I'm like well this is either a bot or this is a foreign government running one of these like puppet accounts Yeah you might like being a historian because it sounds like that's very similar to what I do in the historical record not on social media but you know most a lot of what I'm doing is following this source that cis this source that cites that source is like where's the origin of this thing and you can see the it's a game of telephone.You can see the transformation along the way, one of my favorite examples comes from my first book, I was writing about William Donovan, who was the head of the OSS, and he was this really you know larger than life individual, a World War I War hero, he had a Medal of honoror and all kinds of stuff.And there was this really great quote in a book. And it was describing Donovan basically as that. He was the kind of guy that would dance on the roof of the hotel, and he would, you know, you know, he would, destroy these planes and whatever. And I thought, man thats.😊

Exciting quote to encapsulate who he is. So I was reading this book. And I okay, I'm gonna mark that quote. I'm gonna come back and see where does he, what source is this from. So I can use that in my book. So I go to the source. It turns out it cites another book. and it's like, okay, I've got to get that book. So I go to the library. I was teaching at Louisiana Tech at the time. go to Louisiana Tech Library. get that book. open it to the page that it says, find the quote,, here's where it is. now go to the back of the book, see the note. the note cites another book. It turns out I had that book. I own that book. So I went back home.Go to that book. and do the same thing. Look for the source of this quote. It turns out it was a book I didn't have in the library didn't have. So I had to put an inner library loan, you know, in in use. So I had to basically request that my library get the book from a different library. That was gonna take several weeks. So, okay, now I gotta wait. In the meantime, I go on Google books. I start searching this quote for other books. It turns out they basically cite the books that I had already consulted. So that's a dead in there. I have to wait for this other book to come in. And in the meantime, I'm thinking to myself..😊Yeah.That quote sounds awfully familiar. What do I know that from, It turns out I had already used that quote in my book, but it was from a different. It was in a different context. It wasn't talking about William Donovan. It was talking about just people in the O S S in general. And the quote was different. It wasn't like the same quote, But it had many of the key words. And you could tell that it was, it was the same thing. but somebody had changed it. So now I'm thinking, did I use like a fake quote. You know, in this book. So I got to figure out in my manuscript where I got this. It turns out I got it from this book called Wonder by this guy named Sterling Hayden.The actor, later an actor, he was in the OSS.And he had used the quote because he was quoting he was talking about when he was in Europe after at the end of the war, he told someone he was in the O S S. and they said, oh, the O S S guys are the kind of guys who blah, bh, b, bla, blah, And I thought, okay, well, he's recalling this from memory. So this must be the origin of the quote. Then what are all these other books quoting. So finally, that interlibrary loan comes in. and I get it.嗯。And it basically says the quote. And, but it's, you know, it's a little bit different. And it's referring to Donovan again and not just O S S guys in general. And it doesn't cite a source. So I thought, okay, what happened is the guy who wrote that book, He had read Sternling Hayden's book. He had taken the quote. and he liked it, but he wanted to apply it to Donnovan. So we switched the subject. and he changed the quote a little bit. And everyone after that, dozenzens of different books have cited that as that original source. and it was about the wrong person and not even the right quote. that's for one quote.My book, that's the amount of work you have to do. Well, kudos to you for doing that work. right, That's why people like you are so important that you chased that that whole story down to the end. if anyone is interested in that, though, in my book, I cite the original book, obviously, because that's But next to what I said, also see Joseph Perico, blah, bla,la the original book. So that's the book that I originally found the quote in. So if they want to go down the rabbit hole, they can follow his book to that book to that book to that bookow.😊Well, so it's a lot of rabbit holes going down, even just to find the origins of things well, and then apply that to religion.You know, like stories, oh oh yeah, you know, like game of telephone oh my god, you know what what was the original story, Yeah, it's it's a lot of this stuff, the secrecy MK Ul, all the stuff we're talking about about oversight, it it all relatess to the way the human mind works like that the human mind in this instance, would take a quote and for its own convenience, apply it to a different person and change it.it's like we're constantly dealing with all of these factors that are in motion with human intelligence.With ego, with reputation, embarrassment, ambition, power, control. And one thing I especially noticed in doing this, too, is the ability for humans to rationalize anything to agree with what they already think is true is almost limitless. I give an example in this book of a psychologist named Leon Feestinger. He wrote this book calledWhen Proecy Fas. And it's a really fascinating story where he was looking in a newspaper.And he saw an announcement for the end of the world. There was this cult called the Seeer's cult. And they had said basically on December 21,1953, I think it was. it's going to be the end of the world. There's going to be a massive flood. Join us. And so we can get whisked away on the spaceship before the end of the world happens. Festinger sees this. And he thinks this is a great psychological experiment, because they are making a specific prediction. on this day, this is going to happen. What happens when it doesn't happen, So he decides to embed himself in this cult. Basically, he, they knew.😊was a psychologist, but they said, yeah, I sure come on by, so him and some of his researchers, they just sit with a cult on the day that the world is supposed to end because they want to know how are they going to deal with the fact that the world doesn't actually end so.Obviously, there wasn't even a light rain. There was like no flood. And so the world doesn't end.Some people actually do end up leaving the cult afterwards, but many people stay, especially the people who had sunk many costs into the cult. They had abandoned their families to join this. They had donated lots of money. They had quit their jobs basically to be in this cult because they thought the world was going to end. What do we need money for. And so those people stayed. And now, feesting your coined the term cognitive dissonance. So the idea that you're holding two irreconcilable views in your mind at the same time. So one of their views is we predicted because we had received, we have.Reves from God, basically, world was going to end on this day. That's one position they're holding. The other position is the world didn't end on that day. So these are this is cognitive dissonance. How do we reconcile the fact that these two things contradict each other, But we have to believe both of them.So Fesinger was interested in how they would do this. There were a couple rationalizations originally. One was, well, maybe God meant it in a figurative sense, not a literal sense. Maybe it was a figurative flood that was going to cleanse our minds of, you know, something instead, not like a literal flood that was going to kill everyone. But then they said, no, no we actually thought it was going to be a literal flood. So he's in the middle of their discussions when they' rationalizing this. And they eventually come upon the conclusion. God was going to destroy the world. We were right to believe that he was going to do that, but because he saw how.fervently we believed in him and how fervently we believed that the world was going to.

He decided to have mercy on us and didn't destroy the world. So the fact that we believed that the world was going to be destroyed is the reason why the world wasn't destroyed. So the evidence against them becomes evidence for them. We know we are right because the world wasn't destroyed because, you know, that proves that God was taking mercy on us. So this is how they rationalize it. So this is you know, non falsifiable, something that there's no way you could prove it wrong. This is an indication of a bad theory of it's non falsifiable. It's like not tethered to reality. It.Metal mental exactly if something's non falsifiable,, the the classic example for me of non falsifiability is the concept of last Thursdayism. So it's the idea that God created the universe last Thursday. Now, how could I prove that wrong, You know, I asked my students this and many of them say, well, I remember like last Wednesday. I remember time before last Thursday. But of course, you remember that. But God created you and your memories last Thursday. So, of course, you would think that there was time before last Thursday because God implanted those memories.😊In you last Thursday. In other words, this is just a non falsified little belief. You can't prove it wrong, but that doesn't mean it's right. So the capacity for humans to rationalize things. if you start from a false premise, we can rationalize a world to make sure that we believe in that false premise Yes, yes, we do that with everything. We do that with religion. We do that with ideologies, we do that with everything. and it's not's you know people typically associate rationalization with religion or this kind of cult behavior like this group I explained, but actually,I'm a historian of science and it actually plays an important role in science itself, like the method of science, how science works, if you don't mind, if I can briefly describe the philosophy of Thomas Coon, he's this famous philosopher of science, he wrote this the most influential book in the philosophy of science called the Structure of Scientific Revolutions basically explaining how does science change or progress over time, his concept was that scientists operate within a paradigm, a worldview, so we believe in Newtonian gravity or,We have the worldview of the germ theory of disease or whatever it is. So this is our paradigm, whatever group of scientists we are.Within that paradigm, we do normal science. He says puzzle solving. We, we do experiments to try to prove our paradigm right. So if, if my paradigm is, you know, if I'm a follower of Ptolemy, and I believe in the geocentric universe. I'm going to be observing the way that the you know, the planets and the stars are moving across the sky to try to prove Ptolemy right. I'm going to try to prove that his predictions actually come true. So this is just called puzzle solving What scientists actually do. Thomas Coon says many of them, they just puzzle solve, they just try to prove the paradigm right. In the process of doing that.They uncover occasionally an anomaly. An anomaly is something that seems to contradict the paradigm. like, okay, Ptolemy makes this prediction about where the planet should be, but it turns out the planet's actually not there. It's a little bit off. that's an anomaly. And Cohn says, what do scientists do with anomalies. Do they throw out their theory. No, he says they either ignore it or they find a way to rationalize it. Well, Ptolemy made that prediction, but it's close enough to where it, you know, his theory still work for most of the observations we're making, so.😊Scientists usually ignore or rationalize the anomaly. but over time, as they do more and more puzzle solving, normal science, more and more anomalies crop up.To the point where we just can't ignore them anymore, there are just too many anomalies. at a certain point, we realize that our worldview, our paradigm must be wrong. And Cohn says this allows for a crisis within the scientific community. The group of scientists within this paradigm, they enter a crisis period, and it's during that crisis period, when someone can put forward an alternative paradigm that accounts for all those anomalies. And then we accept that as our new paradigm. So it accounts for all the things that the previous paradigm could do. In addition to the.The anomalies that the previous paradigm couldn't account for. Now, we're in a new paradigm. And what do we do, We do puzzle solving. We try to prove our paradigm, right, And in the process, we uncover anomalies. Oh, and werationize them away. But the the reason I raise this point is because.😊One of the integral parts to the progression of science, says Thomas Coon is the fact that scientists are stubborn. The fact that contrary to popular belief. we typically think of scientists as people who are really open to changing their minds. They're confronted by evidence. And so, okay, they're willing to accept this evidence, Thomas Cohn says, if you actually look at the history of science closely, that does happen. But what also happens in a lot of instances is scientists are stubborn and they don't want to change their minds. They're stuck on their paradigm. And so they rationalize away the anomalies. So the same kind of rationalizing that you have within the.Seekerers cult about their belief system is very similar to the kind of rationalizing that scientists are doing when they refuse to throw out their paradigm because they've uncovered these anomalies. But surely there's a way we can make those anomalies fit with our paradigm instead and they don't. So this isn't to say that scientists are members of a cult or anything like that. In fact, there's.。You know, there are good reasons to maybe elevate the predictions of scientists over those of these cult members, because there are structures in place within the scientific community to prevent some of the more egregious biases that they have. However, really what I consider Coon as it's a commentary on human psychology. Coon basically figured out cognitive vidsonance before Leon Feestinger. you know, but Coon didn't have that terminology. Feestinger is describing cognitive dissonance of these cult members. Coon is describing it in scientist. He just doesn't have.Terminology, but that's just what it is And Cohn says that's why science progresses. it's necessary for those people to ignore that evidence because it enables them to keep uncovering more anomalies that eventually leads to the revolution So it's like it's an ironic thing that our ability to rationalize is what allows us to progress in the future wow this is the perfect point to take a break because I to take a leak so this is awesome we'll be right back.Sorry about that.But I'm glad we, we, we took a break right after that epic rant. That was so good. I mean, would you just nailed it. It's so perfect that there's this this bizarre psychological dance when it comes to human beings, even scientists. Yeah, and it's, you know, the main point to make is that it's not.😊The main point is just that human psychology is human psychology, just because you're a scientist or a cult member or whatever, it's not as if you're immune to any of these tendencies.

Anyone is subject to them, it's just human psychology so I tend to think of Thomas Cohn in terms of psychology instead of philosophy. Yeah well it's brilliant and it's just it also all of that all that understanding of human psychology is really what leads us to even begin to wonder what is going on with the human mind, how do you exploit it, what can you do and then you get people like Sidney Gotleap who make a fucking career out of it just they realize,And we're like these very bizarre, complicated thinking apes and we have tendencies and we have these things that we do that protect ourselves and we have these desires and we have these motivations and how do we exploit that, how do we do that for he quotes, national security interests.Yeah.One of the ironic things is I don't think Si Gotlieb is particularly successful in creating like a Manchurian candidate and controlling someone like a marionette and getting them to commit an assassination or something like that. However, there are ways to manipulate people and to influence them to behave in certain ways and they're the typical ways that we associate with like cult behavior. there's a guy named Stephen Hassan. and he had him on Oh, have you okay,,, his bite model, behavior, information, thought, emotion.I think that's a very good model for understanding how actual mind control actually takes place, you know, behavior being like controlling where someone can go, what they can do, what they can eat, when they can sleep, information being restricting someone from accessing outside sources of information, but if they do teaching them to distrust that information, even if they do access it. Well, he was actually in a cold. Oh yeah, yeah, he was in the moonies thought control is like reinforcing previous patterns of thought, So saying mantras,ciiding prayers, creating an us versus them mentality, and then emotion and control is like instilling in someone' certain emotions to make them beholden to the culture to whatever it is, guilt, fear, shame, anger, loyalty, dependence, that kind of thing so.A combination of these four factors is, I think the real mind control, how people actually manipulate people, how, especially cults are able to manipulate their members to do all kinds of.Really insane things like cut off their genitals or commit murders or anything like that. I think it's much more influenced by those four factors than it is some kind of LSD, you know, mind control, Sydney Gotley and M K ultra type thing. Are you aware of the cult that existed in Austin.。There's a documentary called Holy hell I don't think so was that really interesting I believe it took place here in the 90s the cult it's called the Bodie tree I believe and originally they started in West Hollywood and this is a great story It was a guy who is a gay porn star and a hypnotist It was also a yoga instructor so he starts this would have like this book Yeah I believe his name.Was Jaime Gomez and he changed his name a couple of times. One of them was Michelle and I think the other one was Andreas. and so when the cultt A Network started looking at the cults right after Waco and Jolly West started that right the cult awareness yes.。So this guy leaves West Hollywood and moves to Austin and has his followers build him a theater that he can dance for them in front of them. That was the point so that he can like show off, it's a beautiful theater. I almost bought it. Oh really Yeah, we were the original comedy mothership was going to be at this cult Is it downtown No, no, it's West Austin. It's on B caves Road. and it's still there, it's a beautiful theater. And the reason why I was going to it was for sale. first of all, it was a beautiful theater.We wanted a place to put a comedy club. and Ron White my dear friend had performed there. and he told me how great it was. iss like some cult owned it or something. So I was like, all right, cool, when I went to check it, I'm like, this is great. And then I get a phone call from my friend Adam he goes hey man, have you seen the documentary on this cult and I'm like, oh fuck, there's a documentary and the documentary is terrible. It's horrible. However, there's one fascinating aspect of it. Okay, so this guy.Yeah.He had sex with all these people, he made them pay money so that he could have sex with them like they would do therapy and he was having sex with all these guys and they were straight and it was like they felt terrible about it and after it was over like the one guy had sent a mass email like hey this guy's been hypnotizing me and fucking me for the past 10 years and everybody's like I thought it was just me and the entire call falls apart but here's the point.Yeah.This guy had this thing that he would do to them called the knowing. and they would have to qualify for the knowing. They'd have to be ready for it. And only he could decide if they were ready when they were ready, they would have this ceremony, this huge thing. And then he would put his hands on them. They would like, they would kneel there and acceptance of the knowing, and he would put his hands on them and they would have this profound psychedelic experience. So through the power of suggestion through the placebo effect, whatever it is. They.Genuinely have this profound psychedelic experience, this connection to God, this feeling of all oneness to a person.Everyone who left the cult who talked about what a terrible guy he was talked about how they he sexually exploited them and abused them and took their money. And they wasted 20 years of their life with this guy. But that day, when they got the knowing was the most profound day of their lives. even after theyre out the cult, even after they were out of the cult, people weeping about what he did to them.Still talked about that experience as being the most profound moment of their life.Which is like this guy, because he was a hypnotist and because he was also a meglomaniacal. Car is narcistic. Yeah Oh beautiful man like gorgeous man, like six pack ripped body. and it got weird at the end because later in his life, he started getting plastic surgery because he was getting older. And so his looks were going. So was fuck on F cut.

was like, what are you doing Like what are you doing and he would deny doing anything but it was like so obvious and he had facelifts and.He just went crazy, but the point is it's like hed figured out how to not just manipulate these people like all cult leaders do, but have this one experience that apparently was a real experience for these people in some way able to incept like idea into them or yeah if they could just get out then like I got it, thank you, I'm going go get a regular job now but in order to have that, I'm sure you have to go through the whole.ExBecause it builds up some tension or resentment or something. Of course human psychology has to have gone through that in order to maybe reach that. Well, it's just spectacular that he was able to understand that you had to hold it back from them for so long. And like some of them in the in the film would be. They were complaining that I'm ready for it. He won't give it to me. I want it. I wanted so badly, Michelle got it. now, she's enlightened. I'm just sitting here on earth, eatingating carrots. This is bullshit. And you know.It's, it's really weird because one of the things about these cult documentaries is every time you watch one. Like for me, at least in the beginning, I'm like, that looks like fun., in the beginning, looks great. They're all having dinners together. They're all a community. a community. Everyone loves community. They helping accepted. They're all like working in the garden together. Like this looks great. It looks great. And then it always.😊Descends into one guy fucks everybody, one guy takes all the money.One guy one guy wants to be known as the living God. it's just these patterns are so weird they're so weird because they're so similar. Yeah, yeah it's it's the same basic human psychology operating under different circumstances that leads to you know, I mean, there's a classic phrase, you know, history repeats itself or history doesn't repeat, but it remind but it's because human share of psychology. So of course there are going to be similar actions that reminds.kind of this concept of like incepting something into someone or making them feel this were you, you know, this is a little bit before my time. But did you experience the satanic panic and the sense were you keeping up with it when that was happening in the 1980s. I wasn't. you know, I was very busy during that time. But I peripherally remember it. And then later on, we examined it and looked into it. And, you know, we've done a few episodes where we went over it. But it was.Yeah.You know, legitimately kind of crazy. Yeah, you know, because there's a connection between that and some of the, what I would say are M K U kind of conspiracies. There are a lot of true things about M K Ul that are just crazy. But there are also some things that people propose that I don't think actually happened. You know, there are some people who say, for instance, that M K Ul was.It was like getting young women to run around these military compounds where they would be hunted for sport. and it was saying like.You know, there was a vice president who activated a hologram around his body to make this woman think that she had turned into a lizard to make her think that lizard people actually exist. like, you know, there she was saying that.The CIA personnel would impregnate her and abort the fetuses and eat the fetuses and sell some of the body parts in their inter state occult body part business and all this stuff, which I don't think any of that happened. However, there's a connection between.You know, the people who are making these assertions and the satanic panic, a lot of the people who make these assertions say that they recovered their memories through hypnotism, and that is a lot of what was going on during the satanic panic. You had people recovering Me Through Hypnotism about being involved in this ritualistic satanic Ab and in fact, theres a group called the International Society for the Study of Dissociation and a lot of the members were kind of responsible for propagating many of the satanic panic conspiracysacy theory.The president of that organization, a guy named Bennett Braun.He was sued by a former patient for falsely convincing her that she had engaged in cannibalism and infanticide and all this stuff that she didn't do. And he lost his medical lic, and she was awarded $10 million in this lawsuit. But it turns out that many of the people one in particular of the kind of prominent Mca ultratra conspiracy theorists, Her husband, who did this hypnotism on her to recover her memories. He said he learned how to recover memories from from Bennet Braun himself. And he was.Part of this international society for the study of dissociation. So it's like the same techniques that were being used during the satanic panic to so-called recover these memories. It's the same thing in many of these Mke ultratra, what I would say are conspiracy theorists who are propagating these this misinformation about Mke ultra because they supposedly recovered these memories about how these jelly beans were used to control their behavior or something, but it's the same kind of techniques that are being used in both instances. hypnotic regression in particular is very odd because a lot of is dependent upon.😊The questions that are asked while the person's under like that you can lead someone to believe something happened that didn't happen this is what Jolly was some of the stuff that he was this is's really you know what John Ma is John John Mack was, I believe he was a psychiatrist at Harvard He got really obsessed with alien abduction storiesies and he wrote a book called abduction and it was all hyppnotic regressionions of people that have been abducted by aliens Allly.They all had very similar stories but the real controversy from skeptics has always been like what were these sessions like did you leading questions Yes yes, did you lead them to believe and also there was a precedent so do you know the Betty and Barney Hill story okay Betty and Barney Hill were an interracial couple in New Hampshire, I believe in the 1950s where the very first UfoO abduction story and they had an experience on,Highway, they saw a thing, they lost time, and then they couldn't sleep dead, all these real problems and they both wound up going to a hypnotist and separately had the same story.

The same story about being taking a board a craft and being manipulated on the problem is then that story gets out into the zeitgeist right and then you have hypnotic regression where people tell very similar versions of that story and it becomes a thing where like even if the original Betty and Barney Hill story was real now that becomes a possibility in your mind that could have happened to you and then you get hypnotized and someone says,Yeah.Do you see any beings in the room with you, Yes, I do. Do they, Are they short with large heads and large black eyes. They are Like what are the questions, Like, how did you lead them into this hypnotic regression of alien abduction. And I think a very similar thing took place during the European kind of witch craze in the 17th century. These preachers would go around to different communities talking about witches and demons? And so as soon as they left in the weeks following, there is a huge uptick and witch accusations. And.onic possessions is is it a coincidence that right after their as soon as it's brought to your consciousness, Oh I think you might be a witch or all these accusations starts parting around. Obviously, it's like a suggested thing that they picked up from attending these religious rallies. Of course, did you know that when the printing press was first created some of the first and most popular books were all about how to spot witches. Oh yeah, Yeah, like Heinrich Kramer the hammer of witches. you would think, no, no, no, we now we have a printing press iss just all about philosophy and you know.We gonna it's gonna give be able to print the Bible and mathematics. No no, no, no, no, no. if it bleeds, you know, if it bleeds it leads, it's like people are attracted to sensational stories. no it's the same thing about human psychology. They're just the same psychology as us today. And if we're interested in learning these sensational stories. Of course, they want to, too. it was their version of what I'm obsessed with Bigfoot. just nonsense a funny anecdote kind of related to that. I teach a course on Isaac Newton. And he writes this big book The printppia. It's like the most.😊Fous book in the history of science and it goes off to the publisher and the publisher, you know he's publishing this book and right after the Principia is published the publisher gets arrested for publishing pornography. So it's like there's this image of this publishing house where the Principia the most important book in the history of science is there and right next to it is all this smut that he's secretly doing.Yeah.Wow, God, human psychology such a trip. We're so weird. We're such weird animals. And it makes it so hard because we're so weird to find the truth. Yeah, especially when when you're talking about like suggested memories or something like that. There are a few studies I don't remember them, you know, like perfectly. but there's one study that I talk about in this book where this is right after the Challenger explosion. So the space shuttle has exploded. and there were two psychologists, I think there Emory University. And they decide.We going to have all of our students, like 200 students write down exactly where they were when they heard about this, because obviously they're all going to remember this is like the next day, where were you, what were you doing, who told you about the explosion, and so they got copies you know of these questionnaires basically from 10 how and for many students.。Four years later, I think it was. They tracked down, I don't know what40 or 80 of these students and had them do the same questionnaire when the challenger exploded, Where were you, Who were you with, What did, you know, what did you learn, Blalah,lah,, bla, bla. They took the exact same questionnaire and the majority of the students got a majority of the questions wrong. In the sense that they put down something completely different than they did the first time, So it's like nobody was even manipulating them, That was just their own memory that you know, the majority got the majority of these important details wrong.😊There's another intriguing kind of humorous psychological study. I don't know how big the sample size was on this, but it was to determine how powerful our memory is in the sense that, if you just suggest that someone did something,Is it possible that they actually think they actually did. So the suggestion was they took a bunch of students to some vending machines, and they either had them proposed to the vending machine, something that surely you would remember, or they would suggest to them that they had proposed to the vending machine. So, you know, some students would actually propose and other students, they would just tell them, oh, you know, imagine yourself proposing to this vending machine. And afterwards, I don't remember what the percentage was. But a decent amount of percentage of the students who were only told to envision proposing, actually thought they had proposed. And so.The power of suggestion is very strong, so strong, and the memory is so fallible Like I have a pretty good memory for like hard facts, like like the information that I know is true, but my memory of my own life is basically like weird, blurry snapshots that I can recall, and oftentimes what I'm recalling is the memory of my recounting of my memory..It's not really my memory. Yeah, like often the story that you've told yourself. I watched an episode of news radio the other day. It was a sitcom that I was on in the 1990s. I didn't remember it at all. I didn't remember the plot. I didn't remember the lines that I had, I didn't remember like if it was fake if someone created it during AI, I would have no idea whether it was an AI version of news radio or whether unless it was an episode that I really remember like, oh, that was really funny one.。I didn't, I didn't remember this at all. Yeah, and it was me. I lived it. I was on TV, right, so it was like probably a big moment for me at the time, gone. It doesn't exist. I feel like it's ironic. I'm a historian, but I feel like my memory is not that good either. I don't think anybody's. No, I can't be. Well, there's certain people. like, you know that woman that was on taxi. really pretty redhead lady that sitcom taxi from the 1970s.Yeah.God, I forget her name is famous actress, Mary Louer, Mary Louner, Photoic memory Heer, Mary Lou Hener, sorry, sorry Mary Lou, I used be in love with her when I was kid she has a photographic memory like she can remember that it was a Tuesday in 1983 like this lady it's an incredible memory, highly superior autobiographical memory, a rare condition in which people can remember.Remember.

Every day of their lives with precise detail. I wonder if that would be good to have or bad to have She seems very happy Okay because I show a picture of her when she was young I can imagine having a negative experience or a bad memory and then dwelling on that and knowing every single detail of that and having to relive that like in photographic detail every time you think of it. I'm sure that couldn't be a pleasant experience. but that one right above go the above right there not right there bam was her smoke show That was your.😊Oh my goodness yeah, she was so pretty and also photographic memory so you can't lie her like what an amazing person but that's got to be I would imagine it's not a I would take that over not taking that like if someone gave me the option would you rather have an absolute photographic memory or be like not really sure like oh know what happened you know I would take I would take the photographic memory I think the burden I think would be worth it even I think I'd handle it even me for questions like you know,You asked me, how did you come to write this book like you asked me how did you become interested in this topic when I was thinking about the answer to that question, I mean, what I said is factual in the sense that I was doing a dissertation on scientists in the intelligence community and this, but is that really like how I came to this topic I might have read some other book that I read the name Siney Gotlie and that got me interested and you know even even when I'm talking to you about my own autobiographical experience to me it's like.我。I mean, what I'm saying is true, but is it like literally true in the sense that I know with precision that how I came to this topic because I was doing my dissertation on this. it might have been, you know I kind of remember reading Tim Wiieer's book Leacy of ashes and it briefly mentioned in Sydney Gotley been there Maybe I read that And like oh, who's this guy you know So there's a classic joke about how there's a guy looking for his Keys on the parking lot and there's it's night and there's a lamp post right above him and a police officer walks by.And the police officer says sir, what are you doing And he says oh I'm looking for my keys on the ground. they must be somewhere around here And the officer says, oh, well did you drop him right here And the guy says, no, I dropped them in the bush over there but this is where the light is, So this is where I'm looking to me it's like well when I remember my own autobiographic experience am I remembering it how it's convenient to memory it remember it remember it or you know oftentimes often I mean that's the human tendency right I know for a fact.😊I really got into conspiracies because I have a moment connected to it that was a bad experience so when I was in my early 20s this guy there was a friend of mine that was in a band had read this book called Best Evience by David Lifton David Liton was an accountant and I forget what his assignment was but had something to do with the Warren Commission so he goes over the Warren Commission report and he actually read the whole thing it's a huge volume and he reads all this and he finds so many.dictions and so many things that are wrong with it that he starts investigating the Kennedy assassination and he writes this book called Best Evidence and the book is basically saying there's no way the official storys true. And I read this while it was a comedian on the road So I was in Philadelphia and I was doing stand up and I had a show on Friday night and I spent the whole day in my hotel room reading this book freaking out going oh my god they killed So then I go on stage first show and fucking bomb.うん。And I had done really good the night before Did you what happened JK or did you already have No I have my set, but I was like completely freaked out by the fact they killed the president and then I apologized to the manager I said I'm so sorry I read this book on JfK and I'm super bumed out I'll be over it by the second show I promise you and then they were like you better me and I was like I promise I'm good at this I know what I'm doing and the second show was great and they like don't do that again I'm like I won't I won't do it again but I genuinely freaked out so I remember very specific.Because it was you know it was a big moment for me I was on the road and I ate shit at the comedy club like that thing is in my head forever but that book was that was my first step because I was like if this is a true story I mean if this book is accurate someone killed the president and they got away with it and it wasn't just Lee Harvey Oswald, even if he was involved, was and there was a conspiracy to distort the evidence of the assassination in terms of like the difference in discrepancies between the.At dallas when they first received his body to Beththeda mar there's a bullet hole wound that they describe in the daas where they call it a tracheotomy hole in Beththeda mar they were manipulating the narrative to incorporate the single gunman theory have you ever had geald posner on have not okay because know i haven't gone really down the jfK rabbit hole so I don't know that much about it but i know he wrote the book case that book sucks you need to get him together with Oliver stone and he'll take that book apart.I bring him up justca I follow him on Twitter X and he was posting recently about the I think he'd posted about the tracheotomy thing and so but I don't really just the magic bullet theory alone is complete utter nonsense to anybody's ever shot anything with a bullet When bullets hit bone and shatter bone first of all, there's the fact that there was more bullet fragments in Connolly's wrist than were're missing from this magic bullet This magic bullet was only used as a tool.Because they had to account for a bullet that hit the underpass so there was a guy standing under the underpass, he got hit with a ricochet so they're like well, definitely that bullet hit here so we have to tri all these wounds to one bullet so they had to go through Kennedy, bounce around, come out of him, hit Connolly go through him, go through his wrist and then they magically find this bullet in the gurney when they're bringing in the body like when they're bringing in.Conally to get medical assistance, they supposedly magically find this bullet. This bullet has clearly been shot into water. This bullet is either water or pillows. This bullet has no deformations. It's pristine. It's not missing any fragments. So it doesn't account for the fragments in the wrist. It's a total horse idea. and then there's the.

Laugh when you see this's aruer film where his head explodes, it's all the people that were talking about the shots coming from the grassy knoll. It's the fact that.So many of the witnesses died in mysterious circumstances. They died from car accidents, They died from suicide, They died from crime, They died from random acts of violence. Like they did a calculation of what are the odds that all these witnesses would wind up dying the way they did. And it's like some spectacular number. They fucking killed a bunch of people that were there. I'm sure you know this. But Vincent Boliioi wrote like, I think what might be the longest nonfiction single volume book ever written on the Kennedy assassination remembering.History or something like that. It's like 1500ioi that was involved in the Mansonness. Yeah he wrote like a book about the JFK assassination. And if you read Tom O'neil's book, it calls complete crazy person. But yeah, I mean, if anyone has seen that book in person it really is like 1500 pages of like the densest tiniest little print and it was so long that it came with a CD of the notes that were like1 thousand additional pages that couldn't fit in the volume. like a physical C had to put in your computer.To see the notes saying, Oh my God. it's so crazy. I think it, I think that could be like the longest single volume nonfiction book that I've ever seen.😊I would love to get Gerd Posner in a room with Oliver Stone because Oliver Stone, even at his advanced age, he's so smart and his recall is incredible for dates and times and people that were involved. I don't think Lee Harvey Oswald was innocent. I think Lee Harvey Oswald was definitely an intelligence agent I think Lee Harvey Osal with the fact that he lived in Russia the effect fact that he came back to America married a Russian woman. he seems to have like just very bizarre access to I think he was an intelligence agent I think he probably.Was involved in the whole thing, but the calmness in which he describes the fact that he's a patsy after he's been arrested for killing the president like to me, just that that guy's involved in some shit, that's not how a normal person reacts when you get accused of killing the president if you're innocent you go I'm innocent I know' gonna do it this I don't know why they have me or you'd be freaking the fuck out and he's like I'm just a patsy.Yeah.。Oh, are you really. Like, I think you're probably an intelligence agent. is's probably something creepy about you. But, if anyone could get them to talk, I'm sure it's you. I think there was a lot of people involved in the Kennedy assassination. I think there was multiple shooters. And I think it was very coordinated. And it was probably, it probably involved our government. It might have involved the mafia, might have involved other governments.。Some people think it had something to do with Israel because Israel, Kennedy did not want to give Israel nuclear weapons. There's like there's a ton of stuff that's attached to that assassination. But this idea of case closed. Fuck you. There's no case closed in this. This This is one of the craziest conspiracies of all time because it seems to be that they killed the president and got away with it. That's what it seems to be. And then the Jolly West connection to Jack Ruby. So Jack Ruby goes in and kills Lee Harvey Oswald.Then in jail, Jolly West visits him and he goes completely fucking insane completely insane, loses his mind, thinks he's in hell, this fire. the Jews are all burning. like he's like going nuts right after the guy was in charge of all these LSD studies visits him. How convenient One thing you it's been, I don't know five years whenever I read Tomu's book when it came out the first time So I don't remember that well But one thing because I have a chapter on Jolly West and one thing that stuck out to me especially is one of the main.Crusades he had in his life was against the death penalty. You know, he, he, he writes a lot about how it's completely immoral, this thing he doesn't like. So to me, especially there's an earlier case called this Jimmy Shaver case about this guy who abused and killed this little girl that Jolly West was involved into.It seems to me the possibility is also open that.Jolly West might also have had an incentive to dose these people with LSD if he did to prevent them from getting the death sentence, because if they could, you know, appear insane, maybe they would not get the death penalty instead. Why was he so obsessed about the death sentence I don't know. I think he just considered it immoral. what a fascinating thing that a guy would ruin people's lives would consider just ending them to be immoral. Yeah, where a lot of those people wind up killing themselves because of his actions. Yeah, And he ended up killing himself, too,.I mean, he was an assisted suicide with his son. His son, son later wrote a book about this, but his son.Basically, Jolly West had gotten cancer that had metastasized throughout his entire body, and he was about to die, and he didn't really want to go through the remaining months or whatever he had left in agony. And so he got his son to stockpile a bunch of pills and feed him to him when he basically became unable to move for himself. And so that happened to Jolly West. Then the son did that to Jolly West's wife, his own mother later when I don't know exactly if she had a medical issue or something, but he helped her commit assisted suicide. The son wrote a book about it. And then he later committed.To as well boy, man, it's just so strange how so much so many bad things can have come from just a few people.Just a few people and these terrible ideas and this complete lack of oversight. it's so much evil.Including the Manson family because we've talked about it the Ta O'Neill book, please, folks, if you're listening to this, read that book. It's one of the craziest books of all time. by a man completely obsessed with the story that literally chased down nothing but that story for 20 years. and of one of the parts of the book that I really enjoyed is the writing style is kind of like a Gnzo journey like he's part of the story. know you're following on him on the journey to discover this stuff. For me, that was the exciting part of the ride. It's like, oh it's not just telling you the story.Like we're figuring out how a historian or a journalist actually works. He's telling you, now I've got this interview, and I'm going to go do this and I'm going to go find these documents. I didn't write this book in that style because I just wanted to stick to a description of M K Ultra, but there is something tempting about one of the exciting.😊

History is doing the history. and no one really sees that process. You know how I was describing going down the rabbit hole to find the origin of that quote. There are a million stories like that about how it's so crazy., for example, there was, there was this.😊Gu named Vaner Bush. He was President Roosevelt's unofficial official, really science advise during World War2. And some people say Vanvar Bush, but it's actually connected to the Bushes. No, no, no, no, no,, no different bushes. But it's Venr Bush. Bush himself says that it rhyme with Beaer. his name. So it's Vie.But he was writing his autobiography, he was in charge of like coordinating scientific research during World War II.And when he was writing his autobiography, he did this series of interviews that were like 1000 pages long so that he could kind of talk about his life, and he would use chunks of that. And as part of his autobiography. Well, I wanted to get that because for my first book, Vanver Bush plays an important role because he's the guy who gets Stanley level a job in the O S S and Stanley Loves my main character. So it's like, oh, Vanver Bush is like one of the main guys who is, you know, playing a role in this story. So I go.😊There are a couple different archives that have this.0 page interview that Vanva Bush did. And every single page is there in one of the versions, except two pages that talk about Stanley level in the O S S. And I thought that's the exact thing I need. Like, how is it out of 100 pages, The one thing that's missing is the two pages. And so I finally eventually find out thats another copy of this interview at a different repository like at George Georgetown University or M T, I forget which one it was. So I get them to send me a photocopy of every single page.And it turns out that had the two missing pages. So it's like, oh my gosh, now I can actually use that information because but they didn't have the two pages out of 1000 that I actually needed. They were missing. know there are like 1 thousand stories about these crazy coincidences that happened. One of them, again, from my first book.😊Was.About Stanley Love, you know, he's this chemist in the Os S creating all these ingenious like gadgets and whatever. He talks in his memoir, about his wartime experience about being on this biological warfare committee, where they were discussing the possibility of using anthrax and tuleremia and tuberculosis and, you, distributing this to across towns and just discussing what would happen, What would what would we need to be able to do this, What would have to happen for us to engage in biological warfare. But he talks about this in his memoir, but.I had never seen, you know, a copy of that meeting minutes of that meeting or anything. He, he said that this, this group, this Biological Warfare Committee, it was part of the National Academy of Sciences. And I thought, O, well, that's interesting. But, you know, I can't hardly put it in the book if I don't actually have the minutes in the meeting whether they're talking about this. Ca Stanley Lovell was known to exaggerate to say the least some of the stuff that he was up to during the war.Yeah.But then I thought to myself, I kind of remember several years earlier when I was writing my dissertation before this book, I had gone to the National Academy of Sciences because I was working on, some scientists in government. and I ended up taking just a bunch of pictures of a lot of the materials they had in their archives, and I went back through the material that I already had. and it turns out I had taken pictures of the minutes of the very meeting Stanley Love was talking about in his memoir. It was already in my possession. I didn't have to go there. I already had it. It's just a crazy coincidence that I already had the thing.Exact thing I needed. Wow So they they the the process of making history is sometimes even more exciting than the story itself. Well, the process it, it seems like it takes a very dedicated person to chased down that process like all this things, all the things you're saying about finding those two pages, the quote like there's so many versions of you wanting to absolutely be sure, which is so critical and I'm so glad that you did that I can chase down those things because a lot of lazy people wouldn't have gone that far, right yeah.Yeah no one's watching. Yeah books you could cite like, oh, it says here's the quote. Yeah, but for me, that's the the enjoyment of it. You know, I enjoy doing it. I like going to the archives. I like finding things I feel like a detective. You know, I'm in the archive. And I'm looking at these documents And oh, I find this guy's name is mentioned here. I know okay, so to me, it's exciting. It's like a treasure hunt. So that's, that's the fun part of it., do you have a hard time communicating with people that aren't familiar with all this stuff in in terms of like this subject gets discussed.😊And someone brings it up and they start asking questions. Do you, do you have a hard time of not looking crazy. Do you know to me because' like, there's a lot of people that are like very intelligent, very educated.People that have not just no information about this or no knowledge of this, but an aversion Yeah because it's naturally a thing that you would assume could not have taken place. but it's not just that. It's like there's an aversion to even rationally discussing it Like I don't I am not the type of person that's gonna to sit here and do conspiracies with you. I've had a few conversations like that with people that do not believe in conspiracies. And they always fall apart under scrutiny that.That narrative falls apart Well you don't think they exist Which ones don't you think exist Well a conspiracy I mean to me, a conspiracy is just a secret plot to do something There are a lot of secret plots, of course, all throughout history I mean there are conspiracy theories in the sense that there are stuff that people make up and isn't actually true, but to say conspiracyspiracies themselves are necessarily false Well, any secret plot is a conspiracy not just that I think we live in a day and age where there's a lot of fake conspiracies that are thrown in to muddy the water.OhYeah, yeah, you know, in fact, that actually ties in at the end of this book. I talk about a little bit about kind of the.What's kind of called censorship through noise, the idea that we can put so much noise out there that no one's really going to know what to trust. And so I give an example of the idea that AidDS was created in a government laboratory like Fort Diedch and then in the really 1980s, there was a Soviet kind of propaganda, mouthpiece newspaper in India called the Patriot. And this would just published like KGB propaganda Wow and India in India. Yeah and one of the stories in that newspaper was.Basically saying AidDS was created in a government laboratory, but it doesn't just say that in order to get there.

First said, did you know that the CIA was involved in dosing people with drugs, which is completely true. Did you know that the military was involved in in spraying certain germs over cities to, know, determine the distribution of the air currents to see if we were attacked by in biological warfare situation, how the air currents would spread these germs. They were just spraying like yeast and stuff over. But, you know, it's bacteria. So did you know that this, did you know that they' performed experiments on these drug addicts and this and that and this, And also, did you know that in Fort Diedrich, they created.A biological weapon called Aids. So it's, you know, it's the the lie is made more potent because it's sandwiched in between all these truths. And so this newspaper, the Patriot, published this article.Basically saying all these true things. And then one thing at the end that they were actually pushing. But if you knew that all these other things were true, you might assume that that final thing is true as well. in other countries around the world where they had these front newspapers. they would also published the same kind of story. Did you know that And then Aids was created in this government laboratory. And then those newspapers would cite the Indian newspaper, the Patriot, as evidence that other independent newspapers had also come to this conclusion. And if many independent sources are coming to this. Surely it means that it's got some credibility to it. not knowing that the actual connection, the K GV.Just sponsoring all this know so it's a yeah censorship through noise, the idea that there's certain things we don't want people to know or maybe we do not want people to know, but not understand or something. And so we're gonna flood the zone with all this you know crap basically maybe nobody's gonna know what to believe Maybe it is the case that the CIA created As in Fort Deedch or whatever it is. So that's one tactic that I talk about at the very end It's also a great way to minimize the impact of all the things that actually are true on that list because you something.😊That's completely kooky if you do that enough times you can muddy the waters on basically every subject that there is Yeah so it can go both ways in the sense that fake stories can delegitimize true stories but true stories legitimized fake stories right both ways and then you have the social media impact of bots which is just really unstudied we don't really know the numbers we've talked about this before, but there was a former FBI analyst before the purchase of Twitter he was looking at and he thinks it's 80%.There's 80% of the discourse, 80% of the traffic is it not human or people that are being paid to do it its like some government entity wanting to do this to sow confusion or there's a lot of different factors, there's us, there's them, there's everybody, there's NGOs, there's different ps and they all have like you can go online there's companies that will fund a social campaign for you like so imagine if you wanted to go online.And.Attack people over a certain issue like say if you're trying to get a bill passed and you want to attack people over a very certain issue, you can fund a campaign using bots to promote your position and it could give the illusion of some sort of some agreement online or disagreement online or maybe you could take a thing that's a very reasonable position and make it seem completely ridiculous and then also seem like there's a bunch of support that it's completely ridiculous like a lot of people believe and they start.hs that aren't true and quotes that aren't true. And you could just completely screw up the idea of what the truth is. Yeah, I know the Russian government had, I think it was called like the Internet Research Agency, something like, Yeah, Yeah, and there's there's a book called Act measure Measure by Thomas Rid. And he kind of chronicles what they were doing. basically young people would be hired to pose as whoever anyone wanted to be posed as I guess the Russian government to spread certain amounts of disinformation to certain communitiesmun.Sao just create fake profiles and your whole job at work would be to cycle through these different profiles and comment on people's posts and post your own and then boost the post of your fellow disinformation actors in this IRA so that their posts would be seen by more people. There's a whole, there's a whole.Yeah.Organization or a whole, you know, whatever it is. What was a woman's name that came on to talk about that. Renee Dureta, That's right. Yeah, she was saying how like she had to study all these memes. and so many of them were really funny.And like these people that were in charge of.What they wanted to do was make sure that people online in America were arguing about everything and the more you could get people at each other's throats, the more you could destroy their democracy. This was part of the idea of it just to have another element that people have to deal with and that they were organizing Texas separatist meetings directly across the street from these Muslim meetings, like they were doing it on purpose they were trying to get people to argue with each other, trying to get people.Being conflict with each other. Yeah, and I mean, one of the things now with social media, but just in a globalized world, any amount of conflict is kind of available for anyone to see. So, you know, the worst thing in the world that happens today. You're probably gonna learn about it. You're gonna know about it, which that can't be good for your mental health to constantly been be bombarded by this negative stuff. It's not that in the past, all this negative stuff didn't happen. It's just that in the past, you are probably more focused on your community because it's not like you're got constant access to what's going on.And me and more at the second or whatever it is so the fact that you're constantly able to see the worst thing happening in the world that cannot be good just for your mentality it's definitely not good, but it's also a social experiment because we didn't know what would happen when you get all this bad news from all over the world it's never happened before So there's never been a device that you carry in your pocket that gives you the worst news of the day all day long it's totally new so anybody growing up today it bombarded which is why mean it has to account.For some of the anxiety that kids face today because you see heightened levels of anxiety, heightened levels of fear about climate or anything that they tell you that's the thing that you really need to freak out about, it's like you're being inundated and you don't have a chance to just enjoy the moment that you're in because everything is like this total existential crisis that's going to destroy humanity if you don't act now, oh God.

And it's like, no matter what it is. It's like you're being bombarded by everything. the economy is's a crash. No kings. ice is coming Jayez, you have gun control. Do you have a lot of nostalgia for the pre internet daysca I don't remember it well but no fuck those times That was stupid. I think with the Internet with all his flaws is way better. It's way better. It's way better than the government being in control the narrative and.You know now we know intelligence agencies absolutely in control what's distributed in mainstream news, like the idea that the mainstream news back then was independent and free and they were depressed press like no, no the government agencies and intelligence agencies have been involved in propaganda from the jump and it's way better now you have more access to information. It's way more complicated. It's way more complicated to live your life, it's way more psychologically complicated to be in the moment and to be present.And to just enjoy your life, it's harder, it's much harder because you are constantly being informed and there's the addiction aspect of it, you know, the addiction to being informed, the addiction to seeing what people are saying and seeing that oh oh what did this guy do he stole all this money like we were in the green room last night they were reading the story about this Congressperson who stole money and how they did it and then they bought a giant diamond ring so they wear this giant three carrot?Imon ring on $100,000 a year salary like what are you doing you fucking crazy person, but it's like that that's what you're that's what you're taking in all day instead of your friends instead of your your life and just having an experience in your neighborhood, no, you're just you're constantly looking at all the problems that are happening all over the world all the time and you don't get a break.嗯。But it's better than being ignorant. It's just you have to, you have to find a way to weather whatever that psychological storm is and seek shelter and don't always just stay out there in it and just get bombarded by psychological hail.cause that's kind of what it is. He gotta have a strong roof and stay inside sometimes the.This is a weird transition. But you said psychological ahail. It made me think of this this project during World War I, the O S did called the bat bomb. Have you Are you familiar with No, this it just made me think of these things kind of raining down. But I write about this in the dirty tricks department, but.。During World War  I, there was this concept of how, how can we better target cities or buildings with our incendiary explosives. We can drop bombs. But, I mean, those aren't targeted. They're just going to fall where they fall. And if the winds go the wrong way.re they're not even going to hit the target that we want them to. So this guy named Little Adams. He was working with the O S S.。He had the idea. He had just gone to Carl'sba caverns. What if we get bats and we attach napalm to them, and then we release these over Japanese cities. The bats are going to roost into the buildings in these cities. And then we can have the napalm time delayed so that it'll explode after a certain amount of time that we release them. and it'll set fires to all these buildings. So we have like targeted incendiaries instead of just random bombs falling. So it sounds like kind of a crazy idea. But he happen to be friends with Eleanor Roosevelt, because he had phone plane.😊Before and he had given her a ride in his plane. and they kind of knew each other. So she, he sent this kind of report on the bat bomb to Eleanor Roosevelt. She gave it to her husband, President Roosevelt, who gave it to William Donovan, the head of the O S S. And with a note attached to the thing that he gave to Donovan, It said this this man is not a nut. you know, take this seriously.So Donovan, of course, he gives this to the research and development branch Stanley Lovell that I write about in my first book.And it becomes this bat bomb project that now he Love feels obligated to do because the president's saying we need to research this. So they end up going to Carlsbad caverns and to some caverns here in Texas.And they scoop up a bunch of bats, and they do a few tests with them. They actually get a guy named Louis Pfizer, who invented Naalm to create tiny little incendiaries that you could strap to bats. This is a little bit of a digression. But Pfizer had been at Harvard, he was a chemist there. And when he was inventing Naalm. It was like a jelly gasoline. He would do the tests on the soccer field at Harvard. just like in the middle of campus. that's where Naalm was invented, just like in the middle of Harvard's campus. These bombs would be exploding.😊People would get mad at, people would get mad not because he was detonating these bombs, but because he was hogging the soccer fields and the drill sergeant needed it for practice and so there's like these disputes back and forth but so he was hired by the OSS to create these tiny little incendiaries to straped these bats.。So the Os did S did a few experiments with this before the incendiaries were strapped, they they put like fake incendiaries on them. They The idea was to cool down these bats. and we're going to fly them in a plane over the desert. like out in Utah somewhere. and we're going to drop these bats and see if they actually kind of disperse.It turns out that they were using Mexican free tail bats, which I don't think actually hibernate, but they, they travel south for the winter and so.They cooled down these bats in this like artificial refrigerator. But apparently, they had cooled them down too much. So when they dropped them from the plain, they just like fell straight down to the ground and never awoke up. And so they just flattered across the desert. So that was one of the tests.Another of the tests, they wanted to do a live experiment where they had an actual bat and with an actual napalm bombalm attached to it to see if it could fly off or or to see if it would actually like carry this weight. But they had it in like somewhat of a controlled environment. They, they cooled this bat down and put it in artificial hibernation.😊。And then they were taking pictures of it, you know, to see how everything operated. But then the bat started kind of waking up and it flew off before they could grab it, and it actually flew into a control tower, and it burst into flame. And the whole thing caught on fire and burned down. So it turned out this thing actually worked. but again, it was never deployed against Japan. This is right at the end of World War I. And, they're already the Manhattan Project was kind of successful at that point. So there was no need for the bat bomb. But if people are' interested in that kind of story.😊

Easy that can get thats end in these books, too. Do you, you know about the proposal for the gay bomb.That sounds familiar about like releasing some kind of chemical that that distracts people like they they'll be so infatuated with each other, these soldiers that we can go Yeah not just that, but then somehow or another, it would demoralize them and make them easy to conquer interesting which didn't make any sense, especially historically when you consider the Spartan know, they were all gay. they were the craziest force ever like that's I got to stop people Well you know, that's actually one of the big inspirations for Mk ultra and not the gay bomb, but the idea that we could use chemicals to defeat an enemy army.😊So.Sydney gotley before he was really running M K Ul experiments. He. He had attended a few conferences where some people would talk this guy named Luther Greene, who was part of the Army. and Luther Green was in charge of like developing an experimenting with nerve agents. You know, that could incapacitate. These are like some of the most prop potentent agents that have ever been created. A fraction of an ounce applied to your skin can be lethal. So he wanted to find a substance Green did that could mimic the effects of a nerve nerve agent, like incapacitate someone with actually killing them.。His idea was that if we could get this substance and we can drop it over enemy territory, it could incapacitate these soldiers just through chemical warfare, but we wouldn't actually have to kill them. They would be incapacitated for a certain amount of time. And then we could send the Marines in and they could gather up all these people. and we can conquer this territory. We can defeat this enemy army. without actually having to to kill anyone or for any of our people to be killed. So Stanley Lovel was really interested in this concept. war without death was what they were talking about. war without death, We should use chemical weapon.That just incapacitate people. So one of the things that got I should say Siney Gotlieb interested in investigating LSD was the fact that maybe this could be an incapacitant that we could use to basically eliminate an enemy army for the time being. and then we could go and conquer them without actually having to kill them ourselves. So was he was trying to use it almost as a more ethical form of warfare where you know, instead of killing someone, you just incapacitate themow.W.I think we covered it all.
