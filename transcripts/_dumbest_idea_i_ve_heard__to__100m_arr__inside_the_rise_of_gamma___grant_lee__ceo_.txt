I mean my third pitch in I get to the very end of the pitch feeling pretty good about myself the investor pauses a little bit and then just says that has to be the worst pitch worst idea I have ever heard Not only are you trying to go against incumbents you're going against incumbents have massive distribution You are never going to succeed You guys are at over 100 million AR now worth over2 billion one of the most interesting ways you guys grew early on was influencer marketing all the initial influencers I onboard manually myself I was jump on a call with each one.so that they understood what Gamma represented how to use the product you want to be able to have them tell your story but in their voice I think a lot of people think influencer marketing and they'll think these big trendy creators, people that have a million followers this is the wrong approach you basically give them a script to read immediately feels like an ad that product is not connectedly to them in any way you're much better doing the hard thing which is hard to scale finding the thousands of micro influenceencers that have an audience where your product maybe is actually useful people.rus what they say that ends up becoming this wildfire that can spread really fast something you talk about there is actually a lot of ways to think experimentally even in the early stages we would have an idea in the morning come up with some sort of functional prototype recruit a bunch of people that are legitimately good prospective users that have zero skin in the game ship that so people can start playing in the afternoon we're already running pretty full skill experiment you start actually hearing other people describe their usage of the product you can also watch them struggle by the evening or by the next day we can actually go through all of it together.Okay, we're going back and we have to fix this, this is like not usable and we've done that for everything.Today my guest is Grant Lee C cofounder of Gamma This is a really unique and inspiring and very tactically useful conversation because Grant is building something that is essentially the dream for most founders, a massive AI startup that's profitable and has been for a long time that didn't raise a lot of money for a long time and is a small team it's just around 30 people all who can fit in a small restaurant serving over 50 million users globally if you're not familiar with gamma they're an AI powered presentation.Website design tool they just hit 100 million ARR in just over two years they're valued at over 2 billion and unlike a lot of the fast growing AI startups that you hear about, they're growing profitably and sustainably and in a category that most people did not believe had a huge business opportunity as you'll hear in the conversation one investor told Grant this is the dumbest idea that he has ever heard In this conversation, Grant shares the very counterintuitive lessons that he's learned finding product market fit how he,They had product market fit, the specific tactics that helped them grow, including a deep dive into influencer marketing, which blew my mind also how they figured out their price, his thoughts on building a GTpper company that is durable honestly have been another two of conversation YouTube.of my newsletter you get a year free of 16 incredible products, including Devin lovable Rat B, NM Linear superhuman Descript whisperperuffalo, gamma, Perplexity orp Grnola Magic patternstterns Raycast ChaardD andvin head on over to Leny'snew.com and click Product Pass With that I bring you Grant Lee after a short word from our sponsors.う。My podcast guests and I love talking about craft and taste and agency and product market fit You know what we don't love talking about Sock2 that's where Va comes in Va helps companies of all sizes get complying fast and stay that way with industry leading AI automation and continuous monitoring whether you are startup tackling your first SoC2 or IO27001 or an enterprise managing vendor risk's trust management platform makes it quicker, easier and more scalable.So helps you complete security questionnaires up to five times faster so that you can win bigger deals sooner The result, According to a recent IDC study, Banta customers slashed over $500,000 a year and are  three times more productive establishablishing trust isn't optional Banta makes it automatic Get 1000 off ata.com/lenny.🎼.Did you know that I have a whole team that helps me with my podcast and with my newsletter, I want everyone on that team to be super happy and thrive in their roles.

Thank you for having me. I see your face all the time in my LinkedIn feed I don't know if you know this a thing on these JP Morgan chase heads.

So curious if other people see this or if it just me. Did you know this was a thing. I think it's maybe once a day Now, I get a text message and just just no message, It's just a screenshot or you know, an image of me, you know, doing something in San Francisco on one of these ad ads that were saying. And so yeah, kind of embarrassing. but also, you know, we're happy customers of JP. Morgan Chase. So trying to represent Oh my God. I hope I hope you love them because it's like, it's always you. There's no one else, that's like grant. know can I gotta stop somebody else with every great..I'm totally fond of that. Okay, so to get serious, the reason I'm really excited to have you here is.😊Unlike a lot of super fast growing AI startups, you are both growing like crazy. You are growing very profitably. We're going to talk about this. You did not raise a ton of money when you started. You waited a long time to raise a bunch of money. you also built a business and a category that I think most people never imagined there was this big of an opportunity. and you're basically you' achieved the dream of a lot of founders these days, especially people building AI startups.So my goal with this conversation is essentially do an anthropological study of a really successful AI startup.Talk about how you found product market fit, how you grew, all all the lessons you've learned along the journey, and I'm going to break this conversation up kind of along the different milestones of the journey.Before we get into the first piece, is there anything that you think is important for people to hear kind of broadly about the story of gamma Yeah, maybe I'll just start with a quick story if that's okay and it's really just a founding story so you know we started the company back in 2020 this is peak pandemic and you know fundraising even fundraising was just so different So all of the fundraising was done over zoom you were kind of you know sitting in these zoom meetings trying to pitch many investors you never met in person So just a different error.And so for us, we first time founders, I was actually living in London at the time and so you know different time zone, I had to do all of my pitches at night and you know I have two little kids, so wait for them to go to bed8m we had a pretty modest flat so nothing big.I would basically find this little corner between the kitchenette and the laundry room that's kind of setup up shop far enough from the kids so they wouldn't be woken up.In between 8 PMm like 2 AM I'm just pitching, you know, trying my best I like the fake Zoom background so people didn't know where I was and just pitching. And so, you know, really the first day kind of I'm in my third pitch in trying to tell the story of Gamma, obviously just starting to get the hang of the pitch and you know, get to the very end of the pitch feeling pretty good about myself and the investor pauses a little bit.And then just says, that has to be the worst pitch, worst idea I have ever heard.Not only are you trying to go against incumbents, you're going against incumbs to have massive distribution, you are never going to succeed.And so like in my head, I'm already kind of shell shocked and thinking, you know, what am I going to what's my rebuttal and before I could even respond, he hangs up.And so I'm there sitting, you know, there thinking about it and you know, before I could really get down to myself because I had to prepare for the next pitch, I kind of just internalize this feeling that, you know, maybe he's right.Maybe something about what he's saying is actually correct. and so for me, I started thinking about if we're going to succeed in this category, we're going to really have to think about growth from the very beginning.This category is going to be really really hard to break into and so we really kind of made this sort of kind of promise to ourselves that as we continue to build growth is going to be critically important and so my thing to the kind of you know your audience is that you know I don't come from a growth background so if I can learn growth anybody can learn growth and I think especially in this sort of market hypercompitive oftentimes very crowded it's going be essential.Yeah.That is such a fun story. Oh my God. how how bad must this investor feel at this point won't name names just to share some stats, I know this is gonna be by the time this launches this will be out, but you guys are at over 100 million A now worth over 2 billion a business that again, most people did not think was was gonna at work in this category. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, we feel super proud to have accomplished that and again, yeah I'm excited to share some of you know the growth tactics and things that work.😊For us, I think, you know, hopefully will help others kind of on their journey as well. Okay, so let's dive into it. Let's talk about product market fit.Tell us the story of just how you found product market fit and how you knew you found product market fit. Yeah, I'll start by telling kind of the moment where we thought we maybe had product market fit. And I think a lot of founders asked themselves do we have it or not. And I think' there's often a sort of temptation that almost fool yourself into thinking you have it. And so we sort of did our first public beta launch This is back in August of 2022. We launched on product hunt. And know felt really good. where we felt like was a great launch and up winning.Product of the day, product of the week, product of the month and it was like wow you know I think we have something here and then we'd look at signups and you'd get that initial spike and signups and then they sort of like flatten out you're still getting new users every day but it was clear we didn't have strong word of mouth there wasn't strong organic virality and so if we just kind of played things out you know we knew that the product wasn't going to grow on its own like something was missing there we didn't have that strong word of mouth so that the product could just continue growing.

And so we really kind of asked ourselves like, okay, what do we need to change, and the answer is like we need to fundamentally change everything.It for us almost became the sort of bet the company sort of moment because at that point we were running low and runway, you know we knew we needed to make progress and we didn't really know you know what could be done and so we got everyone together at this point the team was just over 12 people and we said okay, it's gonna to be all hands on deck.Yeah.We are going to do everything we possibly can to make the first 30 seconds of the product feel magical the moment you land into the product it has to be great and has to be so great that someone that goes through that onboarding is going to tell all their friends and if we can get that right then maybe we have a chance at actually doing something in this space and so we spent three or four months actually after the product launch we like felt great but we knew we had to go back to the drawing board we spent the next like three, four months actually revamping the entire onboarding experience.And of course this is also where, you know AI for us kind of played a big role, we actually rebuilt it so that AI was part of the actual onboarding, so every single new user would experience this sort of magic in the first 30 seconds, and so we relaunched this is end of March 2023.嗯.。And all of a sudden you know we'd go from a few hundred signups a day to now first day it was like a couple thousand and then the next day would be like 5000 signups and then 10,000 signups a day and then 20,000 signups a day and then it just kept going up and we weren't doing any sort of marketing, no advertising, it was all sort of organic word of mouth, virality of the product people using the product and sharing with others where we for the first time really felt this pull like we didn't have to do anything product was just growing and it was just such a distinct difference between that.Feeling and like coming out of the product hub launch where we could have fooled ourselves in thinking we have a product market fit I think the temptation would have been hey, let's just spend more on ads or spend more on marketing because like we'll just fuel the top of the funnel and everything else will work itself out I think that would have been a trap I think that would have let us down to like this path of trying to brute force our way into product market fit and it would just always be sort of a fleeting sort of destination would never actually arrive and so I think we made the tough call the right call It was a sort of be the company moment.And I think on the other side, it just felt so different Grant, this is exactly what I wanted on this conversation to be I'm so I'm so excited I have so many questions I have to follow up on the stuff you shared before we even get to the rest of the journey so one is essentially what you're describing is product market fit to you was when,😊Okay.Organic growth started to really take off and it was just growing through word of mouth. You weren't doing much because it was so awesome people were telling their friends about it. Is there anything more there that might be helpful for people to share just to hear about just like, okay, here's what it actually looks like. Yeah, I mean, one piece of advice is that when you're early on your mindset should almost be like you're trying to create a word of mouth machine right Like if you can get that part right, everything else becomes significantly easier. And if you have any and I think this applies to both like prosum.😊toC as well as even B2B products like if you have a B2B product, even if you're not telling all all of your friends, you should be telling colleagues where like that product is relevant, you should probably be telling former coworkerworkers where hey you've discovered something like oh I wish we had this in our prior lives and that should even be magical and then you should see that in all the leads that are coming through like or people coming through through your prospects and your existing customers if you're not seeing a healthy chunk of those leads come through that way, I would go back and I'm like why why is that not happening?Because again, that's like the massive tailwind you need where everything every single thing you do on top of that, all the marketing, all the sales, all the advertising you're just gonna have like it becomes way way easier How much of this was you described it as a word mouth machine how much of this was like Word of mouth loops and virality features versus just the product itself one was awesome and two is kind innately shareable because it's you know presentations people share with each other Yeah totally I think for us we do benefit from being in a category where you by nature of it if you like.I you're sharing it, presenting it to others so I think for us it's a combination of both and ideally you have other ways where you know word of mouth or organic morality can happen in your product so by nature of usage like it's being shared we basically had an internal mantra that we go back to like the first 30 seconds we want it to be dead symbol for someone to create content we want to be dead symbol for them to share it and everything we did kind of for that first 30 seconds or you know call it the first few minutes is remove friction so that they can do both of those things create.And share and I think other people, you know when you look at your own product, you think about okay, what is it you know what is it about my product and how it gets used can you remove friction such that it can actually spread and even if it's locally within an organization or like you know within a workspace like just be able to enable that as much as you possibly can the other really profound point you're making here is the story of you one product of the day on product hunt which alone is so hard so many people try to win and don't most most people don't like I've tried to help companies.W and it's it's like a really hard thing to achieve. And then you want product of the week and product of the month. And still you're like, no, this isn't working Most people.That achieved that or like no, we got this. And they would not have to bet the company. There was no feel. there wouldn't be a feeling if we have to rethink everything. What is it just what is it there, They just like, no, we need this isn't gonna to work as much as as exciting as this is this isn't it. Yeah, I mean, part of, you know, being a founder is being, you know.

fulware as you can and be your your own worst critic right And so oftentimes you want to have these vanity metrics I feel good to celebrate and you should celebrate, but you should know when it's a vanity metric versus is this core to our growth engine like if this number goes up, does it mean the product is working and I think that's where we looked at like okay felt good to when those things we we kind of put ourselves at least on the map but it wasn't good enough to actually have this sort of feeling that we had a core growth engine we could just invest in and get better better that wasn't.So essentially it kind of started to just plateau and slow. it wasn't like this rocket ship that took off from that. Yeah, it was still like we' were still getting signups like they're coming through, but you could just tell there wasn't like where't this like building momentum you know and I think that' that's where it's always hard to tell you kind of have to you know me and my cos we sat down or just we're trying to be honest with ourselves like okay, is this gonna to be enough and it just really felt like it wasn't going to be the other point here is the power of onboarding, which comes up a bunch on this podcast when you.Talk about driving retention So you so you launched product hunt did great and then started kind of petering out how much did the product change after things started to work versus onboarding just like how important was onboarding and then just tell us why the first 30 seconds, where did you come up with that number Yeah so for us you know the onboarding and the product experience for us that's intertwined right the analogy I always think about is you know you know if you go into you know a restaurant and you know maybe the food is good but.When you really think about the user experience it's like the moment you walk into the door, you get seated, the waitress waiter comes by, creates you, you get order and of course the food has to taste good but if that entire and then you finally get the bill and you leave is that entire experience something that feels delightful is it good enough for you to tell your friends about if someone just came by and dropped the food on your plate on the table and like just left and never came with a bill're like okay man' I'm not going to recommend this to somebody else and so for us we thought about the first moment someone walks through our door?Upp and into the product.What is what is something we can give them Can we shorten that time to value as much as possible A lot of this is inspired by you know like Scott Belski, he talks about kind of that first mile, the first1 team minutes and I think that's totally right and I think one approach is you think about new users as you almost have like a cynical view of them you have to think about them being selfish,vain and lazy right like they're coming in they have no desire to learn a new tool and so what can you give them in that first 30 seconds that earns you the next 30 seconds and then the next 30 seconds and so for us.We knew that if we can't know people's attention span is even shorter today than maybe 10 years ago and so what is it in that first 30 seconds can we actually show you something and earn the right to kind of keep kind of building that relationship with you we really thought a lot about that and certainly that's all we could really afford at the time we only had 12 people building and's like we couldn't make entirely revamp entire product we knew that we had to at least put all of our energy into one spot and so we made that coming into the door come through the door, make that feel.moment feel magical so that we can do a little bit more over time. I love your point about how, you know, you could think of it as like, okay, it's onboarding versus the product. the lens of how do we make this incredibly valuable and ahaish for the first 30 seconds almost inform what the product should be Yeah, it really helps you you know pull forward what is the most magical thing about your product right sometimes founders will think about like the 510 features Well maybe there's only like one thing that kind of differentiates you know I try to learn a lot from you know you know.😊We'll get into some of the marketing pieces of this but even just having this sort of founder- led marketing lens of like what can I do to help a new user just understand you know there's this thing from like consumer advertising which is you throw a consumer one egg they can probably catch it you throw them four or five eggs they' probably can drop all of them and like oftentimes founders want to talk about the four or five features they have maybe 10 features and then the consumers totally confused like why do I need this thing we try to just give them that one egg that one first experience where like.Okay, you know, create a slide in seconds. That's that's the egg. I'm gonna throw you this egg. Is that compelling to you. Some people are still gonna opt out, But for the people that catch that, you're solving like a real problem for them and then you can continue kind kind of building on that over time. like you've given them enough so that they'll sit around and like keep playing with your product That is an hilarious metaphor I've never heard for onboarding time to value just focus on one I get of time Just going even further back. What was the original insight that.😊Yeah.。You had that LED to gamma and what gamma is today After the last startup I was at was required. I went back into kind of my roots, which is consulting. I was advising early stageage startups and the sort of medium I was using was Google slides. So I just remember this, you know late night trying to prepare for next day's meeting trying to format and figure out the right layout and spending hours just trying to get the sort of look and feel right rather than the content itself. And for me, that just felt completely backwards. know, I should be spending 90% on.TheTime on the content,10% maybe be on the design and formatting and so the question just was, you know what if there's a better way, what if we could reimagine this format from the ground up slides have been around for almost 40 years as the default you know medium of choice for a lot of this and so we thought about okay if we had different building blocks different primitives so you're not locked into the fix 16 by9 slide what could you what could we offer to new users and so that was really the start of Bu of this like hearing this like could see why investors would be like.

You know, like, I guess so. But slides has been around. PowerPoint has been around 40 years. Like I get it, You know, I get why people be and specifically AI. was that a part of the vision initially or did AI start to come up and then, wow, great timing, great timing. It wasn't part of the original vision, although the spirit was there, which is we want to make it incredibly fast and effortless for people to create content. So it just so happened that AI was a magical gift that allowed us to do all those things along the same sort of ambition or vision that we had.😊And so we integrated it core to kind of all the building blocks we were already building well before AI was part of the picture it's such a cool other example, there's so many examples of ideas that were not possible before are now very possible with AI and it's a great opportunity for people to come after as you like places categories people think is an impossible place to build a big business AI now allows it.Awesome, speaking of that, let's talk about the growth journey and how you actually grew from nothing to 100 million error in just over two years.I'm thinking we break it up, I know these milestones aren't that clear, but kind of like zero to 100 million AR, one to 10, 10 to 100, something like that.And let's just kind of see how it goes how did you get your first set of users, How you get your say first00 users, How did you get to 100 million error from zero Our first00 looks very different, I'd say as though this was even pre the sort of AI La had know the first0 users for a product like ours you're trying to convince all your friends to use the product. Any that's ever made a slide deck you're trying to talk to and I think early on your friends want to do you a favor so they're going to try the product they're also going to lie to you they're going to tell you how great it is and then you look at the usage.'s coming back and so I think our first0 was sort of like gradually hardear post sort of the product account launch, people learning like okay this is kind of becoming a little bit more useful usage was still pretty episodic so they weren't coming back every week and then I think do think the moment post sort of the AI launch is where all of a sudden we saw that sort of organic growth happening people coming back to the product regularly and so that's where it wasn't even the first hundreds like the first10000 users all came within a pretty short time period after that initial launch.Awesome, we're going to talk about monetization pricing later, which is obviously an important part of actual getting to millionaire hour and 10 millionai. So what i'm hearing essentially is the product cut launch was a big part of just the first 10000 ish users.😊I know there was also a tweet when first when you relaunched that helped in a big way talk about that.Yeah, so when we did our AI launch, we didn't do our AI launch on product To, we just basically said, hey let's just put it out on Twitter, see if we can get some virality and honestly we kind of came up with kind of a clickbaty sort of tweet it was like the most valuable skill and business is about to become obsolete and so you know it was intentional in that we wanted to create a little bit of engagement, we knew that having sort of a more provocative in a tweet would allow people to engage with it.And so after a couple days all of a sudden it started getting a little bit more viral and a lot more engagement and we looked and it was basically because Paul Graham had commented and saying something like surely the thing that the slide deck is describing is more valuable than the slide itself right and obviously it was fun just to see that comment I think once that comment came through like even more engagement on the post and then that was really the whole intent of that post was just to be able to have that level and the engagement so that people we have some level of reach..And so for me it was almost like my first sort of learning moment going back to you know what does founder led marketing even mean it means like how do you actually break through the noise, how do you get a chance to have people even engage with like a post like that part of that is copywriting part of that is like storytelling part of that is just having like even like the right visuals to share and so it was for me kind of a moment just understanding hey they kind of do this right you kind you kind of have to do things that maybe you're not super comfortable with but it makes a difference such a fun story.Ptentionally set that announcement up to be controversial is what I'm hearing. To, yeah, I'd say provocative, little spicy. That is so cool. So essentially, you got to 10000 users.😊Through product hunt and then essentially one controversial tweet that ended up baitating Paul Graham to comment amazing and was it a, it was just a comment. It wasn't even him retweeting it.Not just a comment. Yeah, and then others would you know Pa on Yeah, it's interesting how much a comment can increase the distribution of a tweet versus them retweeting it or quotetweeting it and of course, the algorithms change all the time. So part of which just long based on when it happened, how it happened who posted and use this term founder led marketing, which I love and I'm already seeing it in action here is this is you thinking about it's not like delegating to someone in marketing, It's not hiring an agency. It's like how do I tell a story that I think will break through the noise.Based on you building this company, having the insight to build this product And I guess is there anything more you there you think is important for people to hear about the importance of the founder thinking through this stuff. Yeah, I mean, I think very know most people today are probably familiar with founder led sales, which is still very, very important. I think before you hire your first know salesperson or Ae it's great for the founder to understand like what it takes and you know, they're gonna craft the right narrative, the right story my previous role I was the CO at a startup where I was doing a lot of I was.But I was early. and so I was helping the.

unders go through this and really helping go into meetings with a client or prospect and saying hey, this is why know our product is interesting and I think today there's so many AI startups that are much more either B to C or perumr and so you're not necessarily talking to individual prospects but the idea that you can be really in control of the narrative on the marketing side is really really important and I think describe a few things where over time I think that skill set just really really helps you one.Is like you have a chance to kind of be a creator yourself these days, I think a lot of founders are trying to be more active on social media and I think you if you can kind of overcome the initial cringe factor of like seeing yourself and post things like oh, this doesn't feel authentic, if you can overcome that initial feeling you start investing into like, okay, how do I become a better copywriter, you how do I articulate something that is clear, not just clever, I think there's that saying where obviously if you can have that clarity that's super important and most.People will try to get super like creative with their with their copywriting, but that's not usually the right way to break through and communicate something so how do you improve your own copywriting and then that allows you to actually have a higher bar.When you start working with other marketers or in this case like for us like working with influencers if you're working with influencers and creators and you can totally empathize with like how they approach that work and you know what a good hook looks like or you know how like a just structure a good post you can only do that if you've kind of gone through it a little bit yourself and you know how hard it is and I think too many founders will then just say you know they'll write something that just feels so much like an ad and then then they'll give it to a creator to help amplify and that just never works right so.I do think part of found lead marketing is like going through this yourself, using your own platform in the beginning it's probably going be super small but as you get bigger like you have a platform to you have a voice and people listen and you're gonna to get better and better in your own storytelling I think these are all skills you should invest in as early as possible because you know you're gonna have to do get better and better it like practice you got to practice over and over I definitely want to pull on this thread more because you tweeting the lessons you learn building gamma is what led to this conversation I was reading and I'm like okay.Sharing a bunch of stuff where there's so much more I want to hear and we're gonna talk through this and go a lot in a lot more depth than what you've shared on Twitter but I love that that's example of that working having this conversation so let me ask a couple of questions here one is just how do you find time as a founder CEO of a very fast growingrow hectic crazy startup we have so much to do how do you just like allocate the time to do this and then any just key lessons you've learned about doing this well beyond what you've already shared for people that are not want to try to start sharing things on LinkedIn and Twitter?？My advice is definitely just to try to start small, don't let it become so intimidating that you just don't get started for me, it was like just having a notad or Google Doc around in the beginning where I would just constantly jot down okay this is something I learned or something I observed or something that worked't well something that was unintuitive but worked and just start creating a log of that and then once I had enough of those and I'd spend basically every week I'd to block off a few hours to go a little bit deeper I'd take a lot of those bullet points and try to,So is there enough here to turn this into maybe a post or something that can be shared broadly and in the beginning I didn't have enough, it was all sort of scattered thoughts but over time you start accumulating some interesting themes and then I would start stress testing that some of that so I would tell you know my teammates like hey this is something interesting like did you find this interesting and if there were enough like oh yeah that's I would not have expected that or that's something I've never heard before then I'd actually start crafting the initial post and then you actually just put it.I think what I've learned is even for LinkedIn versus Twitter the audiences want different things and so you almost have to then have different tones of voices or like even nuggets are sharing for me I invested much more in LinkedIn early on just because it felt a little bit more natural for me and then over time I said okay I'm going to start packaging certain content for Twitter that's actually different than what I would post on LinkedIn sometimes on Twitter you get even more tactical or even more into the weeds and so I found that that to be helpful but honestly I'm still learning so like every time you post you go.know after a couple weeks you go and say, okay, what things are actually being engaged with like are things actually creating like ideally you're creating enough value where people are either bookmarking it, sharing it, retweeting it, you know these things that are signals for there's something valuable there and then you just go back and you start collecting your own sort of you know these are my allstar posts like these are the ones that I've actually broken through and then you go back and try to understand okay what about that post or I think was actually useful or is it the actual content, was it the structure of the content?Was it some sort of contrarian advice and you start thematically bunching that together such that as you're brainstorming every week you just have a good sort of you know body of work to work off This is so interesting and valuable so let me mirror back a few of the lessons that I heard here that I think is easy for people to miss so one is just what to share.Yeah.What I heard here and I completely agree with this, and this is what I try to do is pay attention to things you've learned, things that you find interesting, things that are unintuitive to you, just like have a doc and just put these there every time you learn something, find something interesting, just add it to the dock.or he I haven't heard before is a good one too, so it's essentially just like if you find it interesting people on social media will also find it interesting and ugly one approach is,

Share it as it's happening, which is what I try to do just like, oh, I just learn this thing with clock code with clock code check it out or save it up for a big long post.The other interesting I've never heard this before I've like post different things to LinkedIn and Twitter I just copy and paste the same thing, I love that you do something different for the two platforms I think we all kind of have intuition that there's different audiences right and so if you know that kind of fundamentally then the question is you how do you package up the story the right way so that there is you know the audiences is ready to receive it and I think these going differ by know by the type of creator or the founder whoever's posting.And of course the actual content itself and so for me I'm still tweaking, but I do find that just copy and pasting you know from one to the other doesn't usually work it really like you almost need to be in the right mindset of like what do I think will be more engaging on Twitter and then what do I think will be more engaging on LiIn and and then kind of test a bunch see what actually works go back and iterate a little bit So if you had like one bullet point tip for what works on Twitter versus LiedIn you share maybe more tactical.Twitter is there anything more there you can share Yeah that's what I've found is like tactical, oftentimes more contrarian on Twitter and also I would say technical too people really like to know again going into going back to like getting into the weeds like is this something I feel like I could replicate and I'm not going give you like there's no credibility if you just give like a blanket statement or something that feels generic like I really need to know if you can show me the metrics even better I feel like that versus like LiedIn it's more oftentimes more.or even just either more aspirational or aspirational or like a topic or theme that just feels like relevant at that point in time and you can just kind of make more of a broader statement it doesn't need to be as tactical it's more like inspirational it like oh okay now you need to go and learn a little bit more about pricing and packaging for instance and that could be the sort of spark that somebody needs and you don't need to spell it completely out part of is also that on LinkedIn you can't really do threads and so doing like a super long.Form post isn't as practical. Maybe that changes in the future where maybe the tactical pieces, you know that element might might actually change And last pieces you said you just block off time I there like a specific time of the week you do this He actually because everyone's like sure I'll block off time and then know okay but I actually gotta do all this other stuff I'm not gonna use it this time or maybe next week for me it's usually two times of the day very first thing in the morning and lasting at night and partly is because of kids it's almost like I need time but there's just zero distraction.no noise in the house and so I can actually think and and then you know I think in the mornings it's about where are you finding inspiration like where are you like what are topics you're energized by and then I think at night it's about reflection like what are the things you actually went through that day you could almost pull up your calendar and be like okay I talked to X Y and Z people and was there anything from those conversations that might be relevant that's where I write some of those things it's more of a recap of actually what happened and what helps me to not feel like this is some cringy selfproe ego.Tististicical stuff is just.It's useful stuff that I've learned that ends up being helpful to people and people in the comments are always just like oh that is really cool and useful Thank you it's not like self promotions's not just like look how amazing I am look and check out my amazing products like here's the thing I learned you might find it useful.That's exactly right I think you one way of thinking about it, you know with like founder led sales, it's always about like exchange of value right you want to be able to give them the customer this feeling that they're getting an amazing product in exchange they're going to pay you money for it I think with like founder led marketing, it's almost this mindset of you want to give people a ton of content, maybe it's like a value in the content or're just sharing something maybe some secret tactic or you're giving them something where.ly there's value in it in exchange, you sort of get goodwill back you're not necessarily getting money back, you get goodwill. they're going to follow you, they're going engage with your pose, they're going to tell others about it. And then over time, you can exchange maybe some of that goodwill for like actually talking about my product and like announcing it and they're going to help amplify the news and I think that's magical you kind kind of bank the goodwill for a long period of time by providing just a ton of value with no expectation of anything immediately in return. The book I always point people to when they're when they're struggling with this sort of thing and like I did this and no one.Like no one cared didn't do any good is there's a book by Scott Presssfield, I think is his name called Nobodybody Want to Read Your Shi.Yeah, which is exactly what is right nobody wants to read it the bar for people to care is very high there's so much stuff to read and process and so this book gives you a really good lens of just like okay, the bar is very high and nobody wants to read your shit so you have to try really hard to make it really good.Yeah.Great reminder. We'll link to that in the show notes. Okay, let's get into, let's come back to the growth of gamma. So we've talked about how you got your first tens of thousands of users, essentially product hunts, rethinking, onboarding, making it really magical. And then this.😊Very controversial tweet that Paul Graham commented, created some buzz. Let's talk about the next phase. and maybe I don't know, tell us kind of the ARR at that point through 100 million, just like broadly, what should we know.So when we got to about 10 million in AR, I think there was this feeling for me, which was we knew we needed way.

To help just continue to amplify and spread the word about gamma. I think it was already working in terms of the organic virality was there. And so we we did feel like it was time to start amplifying some of this. And I think the main blocker in my mind that I started feeling was that our initial brand was sort of holding us back. And I think a lot of people will discount, you know whether or not a rebrand is valuable. And I think sometimes is sometimes sometimes it isn't for us there's a few different things we looked at. So one our initial brand.It was almost more of a placeholder brand because we created it the moment we sort of incorporated the company, which was again like late 2020 beginning of 2021 where we needed something so that as we built we could at least share it with people we could put up a landing page and just feel like okay there's something here but we didn't invest a whole lot into it and so it was pretty limited in sort of what I call kind of the DNA of the brand there wasn't that many like the art direction was very limited in scope there wasn't much when it came to like voice and tone and so you know it was.It was something that we knew was good enough to start but it wasn't scalable and when I think about something that could be scalable, it's almost like you can take the ingredients of a brand and replicate it a ton like you're kind of this DNA is something where you can imagine creating tons of content around it all feeling pretty cohesive and don I think that needs to be done by design, like you're really being thoughtful about every single element, like what is the art direction you want to go with, what is the voice and tone such that as you're creating thousands of pieces of copy it all feels,Ptty cohesive and so we kind of went back to the drawing board and we spent many months kind of rethinking what would be you know the brand, what is what is this vision that we have longer term our creative doctor internally partner with Smith Intion an amazing agency that has helped you know folks like perplexity also do their rebrand or their initial brand and we weren are so many months is like really trying to craft kind of what we think is like the core DNA of the brand.。And doing so in a way that we could replicate it as much as possible, replication piece of it comes into play because as you start scaling, you're going to have to create a ton of content, your own content on social media ads for performance marketing assets for influencers to be able to use and showcasing their content and so you're going from like you tiny pieces of content to all of a sudden every week we're testing thousands of pieces of creative, and you cannot do that if you don't feel confident that as you're replicating like.You have that sort of cohesive feel so for us that we realized it was going to be necessary and why we invested so much and ended up being I mean way more expensive, way more time consuming than I would have imagined, but I think coming you know, on the other side of it being the right investment feeling that that was the right time to do I love how many things you did that.Feel like this will not work out building a startup within the presentation space, doing a whole rebrand.In the middle of scaling, also just reworking the entire product after you launched and just like rethinking the whole thing, like all these things, everyone's always like, no, this is not how we went and interestingly worked out for you guys.I want to come back to the brand stuff, but one of the most interesting ways you guys grew early on was influencer marketing, which a lot of people hear about and talk about, I haven't heard a much of like how to actually do this and what actually works.Talk about that as a broad growth lever for you guys and then I want to get into just like what tools did you use who actually was really helpful there, thing like that, so yeah, just give us the big picture.Yeah, I think a lot of founders assume that with influencer marketing it's almost like turnkey, you set aside a budget, you find some creators, you figure out the right campaign or the right moment of time to do it and it's all done you're ready to go and I think the reality is like going back to like this founder led marketing mindset is like well you're going to set yourself up for success if you actually are super involved in that entire process so for us what this meant was like all the initial influencers I onboarded manually myself..IWe would find I would spend time I would jump on a call with each one of them so that they understood what gamma represented, how to use the product, you want to be able to have them tell your story but in their voice right and they can't do that if you're not willing to put in that investment and so we would spend a lot of time like going through it wasn't my job to tell them how to pitch gamma but it was my job to make sure that they understood what gamma was as a product and so we would spend a lot of time like me just walking through the product then asking questions.U like just kind of brainstorming what could the hooks be and me just giving them some initial feedback and like saying oh yeah this one, I love that, I think it's gonna to work great for your audience but not trying to be super prescriptive and working with a ton of micro influencefencers people that don't have massive followings but are committed to giving going back to giving value to your audience like they're committed to giving value to their audiences they want to be able to showcase tools that actually they would use or they are using and how do you do that in an authentic way like you can't really fake that you really need.penend the time doing that and just like you went onboard a customer, you onboard an influencer the same way, you want them to be an extension of your team and I think they can feel whether or not you're willing to put in the work and if you're not then they're just going to treat it like any other project ship it and be done with it if you invest in that relationship know guess what they'll be back to actually post about you again and like you're all of a sudden having this sort of this relationship that actually can build.

Over time. I think that's really what where the magic is, like too many people discount that initial piece. This is awesome. to be clear, influencer marketing, essentially a person with a following answer, Tiktk, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, whatever gets paid in some way to promote your product. That's how you describe that's the simple way to understand influencer marketing Yeah. Yes, that's definitely the simple way. And I'd say, you know, there's definitely different, you know, levels. I think a lot of people think influencer marketing, and they'll think, you know these big trendy creators, people that have like a million followers for instance.😊And the idea is that okay we're going to carve out a really big budget, we're going choose like five or six that we feel like really like the tastemakers in the space and put all of our money into like just help having them talk about our product and I think usually this is this is kind of the wrong approach because many of them you know they do have massive audiences and for you you're basically you basically give them a script to read and it immediately feels like an ad right like they don't feel.Like that product is not connected really to them in any way, it's just something that they're you know for this week they happen to be working with you and then they move on with their life and it never feels organic or authentic and you wasted a ton of money doing so I think you're much better doing the hard thing which is hard to scale, but it's like finding the thousands of micro influenceencers that have an audience where your product maybe is actually useful.Yeah.And for instance, you know for us like early on it'd be you know educators, people that for them part of their job is creating slides every day because they need to engage their students and so like for them you know having a tool that actually save them a ton of time was something they love talking about and if you can find some of these pockets we call them echo chambers where if you find a pocket like educators teachers love telling other teachers about products they love using during summer break they all come together and talk about okay what are the things that were gonna actually improve you know my job.next school season and you know obviously during this AI wave a lot of those have been okay what are the AI tools that just saved me a ton of time and so if you can start actually tapping into these pockets of like echo chambers that's even better like it doesn't have to be this flashy wellknown influencer it's actually just this person that has an audience where people like really trust what they say and that's amazing that ends up becoming the sort of wildfire that can spread really moving fast and what's like that dollar amount these folks get it's like a few hundred.Bs, few thousand bucks, some like that. Yeah, few hundred to low thousands single digit thousands. What are, how do you find these folks, I there tools they use, Is it just like a bunch of manual searching and, and looking.Yeah, in the very beginning it was all manual a lot of cold outreach and then we ended up finding a couple different things One is a platform, a YC company called first collab that has been amazing they basically do all the automated outbound for you plus you can help them you know actually create profiles or personas of different creators so like for instance educators being one and then they'll go out and actually you know based on that profile find all the right creators for you so they've been amazing really great to work with and then we've also found.😊Small agencies to also help kind of augment that like I look for you know agencies that are super young and hungry, these are people that you know are social they're native to social media and so know they really understand it and they can really be able to bring in creators that you know are great to work with and I think part of it is like if you find creators are great to work with everything else becomes easy so we've had a few one is AKG media out actually out in the UK and they've been fantastic to work with as well.So you kind of find a few different things, either agencies or platforms that can help you actually scale the signal and these when they post they they're generally transparent about this is a paid promotion right they're not just pretending I found this tool and I love it.Yeah, exactly right okay and so.how much impact did this lever of influencer marketing have on your growth, say from 10 to 100, like is this the biggest lever of growth other than just word of mouth, people continuing to share it? Yeah, so word of mouth has definitely been the biggest So we look at kind of all kind of new subscriber growth over 50% of this is word of mouth. It's either people searching direct, coming direct entering gamma do or going through search and and typing in gamma like a branded keyword search where they're looking for gamma they've heard about gamma.。But I think for us, social media and influencer specifically has always been an amplifier, so every time we invest in influencer marketing, we actually see word of mouth increase even more and it's always like you can just see it like basically anytime you spend a little bit of money you start seeing people come through influencer, the word of mouth factors is actually 1. we'll get another 1.5 additional users on top of that which has been really interesting to see and I think part of this is just recognizing that and I think we kind of understand it.Like with influencer marketing because why it's so effective, you we all know Dunbar's number, which is you have this number of like 150 people that you call kind of your network and your network you trust more than the average stranger down the street like if they tell you something you know recommend something, there is a sort of halo effect you learn to trust them a lot of these influencers, the reason why they share so much about their lives is because they want to be in your network, they want you to feel super close and once you feel super close, you trust them to actually,Share things are going to be useful. And so when they recommend a tool, there is a sort of payload effect where.

Doesn't not feel like it's coming from a stranger. It feels like it's coming from a friend. And that's where every time we've spent money there, you actually see this amplification is like, okay, that's kind of interesting. You wouldn't necessarily expect that. But for us, it's been this sort of amplifier from, from yeah, the big very beginning. This is so fun to hear about. I've not heard this level of detail on how influencer marketing works and how to make it work.😊。A few more questions here say you said there's maybe a few thousand people you ended up working with roughly initzrs over the course of yeah like a year, it wasn't all in the same time is like you you find basically in the beginning you do in the very, very beginning we had a small budget it was like you 20 creators a month and then you start increasing that to like 50 then 100 and then you we're still not we're definitely not fully scaled at this point but I could easily see a point where you know you're working with many many creators every single month and that gives you a chance to actually test a variety of you know.And content hooks, ways to talk about the product value props amazing and you said the key here is you spend time with every one of these creators influencers early on to help make sure they understand what you're doing and get excited about it isn't just like I thing you outsource I think there's a lot of value there it's hard to again hard to quantify and most creators feel like theyre most founders probably feel like they're too busy to allocate that time but I think it was a good investment because going back to you want them to feel,An extension of your team they're not going to feel like an extension of your team if one, they've never met you and two you've never even told them really how the product works so just they're forced to kind of go to your website to figure it all out Those are gonna be you know not a whole lot of love that they're feeling from the outset So I'm hearing is quality over quality especially when you're getting started and then there's this other piece of niche which I think is very counterintuitive instead of going to large large influencers or a huge audience it's good to folks that are small.Aience size roughly that you think is ideal for this sort of what niche just meansHonestly, I don't think there's a minimum because even with platforms like TikTok, they oftentimes are giving you credit for a brand new account they want to help amplify that new account because obviously if they're thinking from a creator perspective, you if that new creator feels like oh coming to TikTok is like a massive win for me, they're going to be more invested in it and so there really isn't a minimum, a lot of these platforms are trying to shift to kind the,Same thing where they really reward new creators on the platform And so you could have a small audience. it doesn't really matter, you can have 10000 followers that's also good I think as long as the content feels you know again engaging authentic to that to the people you're talking to I think has a really good chance of as you take off that's such a good point with TikTook where it's not follower relateds if it's useful and people find it clickable whatever liable viewable'll'll the algorithm will spread it to a lot of people such a point.系。Okay there's a couple more points you made in the tweet that I want to make sure we highlight so one is you made this point that 90% of your reach in influencer marketing comes from less than 10% of people is there anything there that you think is important for people to hear Yeah I mean this just goes back to it's hard to know where that 10% is going come from so you kind of just have to cast a super wide net right you can sort of I think try to again trick yourself into thinking you're at picking creators or you're great at telling them how to like post about your stuff where the reality is like even for me.Never guessed like I kind of had some idea, but I just had to make sure that I was meeting enough creators broadly such that when you meet enough, they're all posting, there's some pocket that end up just taking off and I was not a good predictor of that I was not smart enough to actually know which ones to take off I just knew that we had to play the sort of numbers game to make it work So any of your tips here is people fail often in this because they start too small or thereby're just a little too small you recommend 10 to 20000 a month over six months.And just trying this, it sounds like you were doing like 20 to 30 creators a month.Is that the right framework for how to just start this thing and explore Yeah, totally and I'd say it's not just that the budgets too small. It would be that they put all their eggs in one basket so you can easily blow that 20 k on just one you know bigger influencer and then be like oh that didn't work. So I'm going to try again that didn't work okay I give up and I think rather than doing that you should be like okay that 20 k. I could actually probably work with know40 different influencers and see what actually works. And we' cross of 40. I'm going to try to find a variety of personas a variety.Use cases spend a lot of time with them and then actually see you know what's working what's not and then next month take those learnings and you know double down like if educators are working, go with educators if consultants are working, go with consultant find more consultants because you're going to be more there I think that's where yeah putting all your eggs in one basket is just probably the surest way to fail because like you're gonna to miss a ton and it's going to take you way too long to learn and you're gonna come to the conclusion that it's a waste of time.。I feel like this whole podcast conversation could be just about this one lever so much I want to keep talking about, but there's more questions here because this is so useful and interesting, you had this line in your tweet about how virality is not an accident and that this approach is how you figure out what actually works and then once you do that then you start leadinging into that messaging talk about that this goes back to obviously if you're testing a bunch you'll finally find that sort of post or set a post actually go viral going back to just the fundamentals like,Make it easy for your influencers to be able to tell your story in their voice. one thing we did, know, we open sourced.

Basically our entire brand, we have brand. gamma. app, which is everything about our brand, our voice and tone our art direction, what we use in mid journeyney to create the sort of art direction that we have so that a creator can do the same and they can actually just copy all of that so that they don't have to reinvent the wheel every time they're trying to post about gamma they have all of that and I think that going back to like this notion of like just make it dead simple for them, remove friction, they already have enough to like on their plate that to figure out don't make it any harder than it is.Remove friction then it's like okay you get into this rhythm of adding creators is easy, having them post as easy reviewing what's working what's not as easy and if you're able to do that relentlessly over many, many months, then all of a sudden like hitting the sort of viral posts is easy because you're going to have enough at bats there where some are going know some are actually going to pop off but you kind of only can get there after you've like on all the hard work before that to make you know kind of remove friction from the process and feeling like it's almost like a you know well.the machine at that point. Is there a platform you find most helpful for the stuff you guys are doing is it like Tiktk, Instagram, LinkedIn, something else. Yeah, I mean, this is one where, you know, for us, we, we cast a pretty wide net too, but it's very clear, you know, LinkedIn.Yeah.The conversion rates are just substantially higher they're4 x, maybe 5x higher than other platforms and I think a lot of people are probably still sleeping on LinkedIn frankly and so it's one where some of the influencers that are our creators there can be a little bit more costly but if you can be highly eventually be more targeted knowing that hey, this type of creator is pretty impactful for our product then working with them it' just like oh that's great the conversion rates are just so strong and it really feels like we're like just getting.Started there So you if in the beginning, you're not sure it's always helpful to cast a pretty wide net and then similar to sort of just the influencer strategy like test and iterate, you'll figure out many of these things will follow the power law. So it's like one or two channels are going be the most important for you for instance, Twitter for us hasn't been that impactful. And I think for tools like notion they've been really really impactful you're not going really know and so just test and then double down on the ones that really move the needle for your product I think to many people sitting now are like wait LinkIn posts are sponsored sometimes.That what's like, how do you know if it's a sponsor post like a hashtag sponsored or something like that. How do they communicate those, Usually they'll say, you know, they're a partner or, yeah, basically it is sponsored in some form or know they'll hashtag know add or you know something along those lines. So that's probably the the way you' you'll see it the most. cool, by the way, I don't do this sort of stuff. If you ever see me on LinkedIn. I'm not doing any paid stuff just so people know and I don't plan to do that.😊あ。This episode is brought to you by Miro Every day new headlines are scaring us about all the ways that AI is coming for our jobs, creating a lot of anxiety and fear, but a recent survey for Miro tells a different story, 76% of people believe that AI can benefit their role but over 50% of people struggle to know when to use it enter Miro's innovation workspace, an intelligent platform that brings people and AI together in a shared space to get great work done Miro has been empowering teams to transform bold ideas into the.Next big thing for over a decade Today they're at the forefront of bringing products to market even faster by unleashing the combined power of AI and human potential Gu of this podcast often share mirror templates I use it all the time to brainstorm ideas with my team Teams especially can work with Mi AI to turn to unstructured data like sticky notes or screenshots into usable diagrams, product briefs, data tables and prototypes in minutes you don't have to be an AI master or to toggle yet another tool the work you're already doing.Miro's Can is the prompt help your teams get great work done with Miro check out at Miro.com/lenny that's MI.com/lenny.Let's come back to this brand point. So one of your big lessons is invest in brand before you go heavy into hit ads and performance marketing. I imagine you do some ads at this plan Facebook and Google and things like that. Yeah, we run ads performance marketing, know, I think there's this this like the stigma that brand marketing and performance marketing or sort of a odds with each other. I very much follow kind of sort of the thought that brand marketing is performance marketing like everything is.For of performance marketing it just might have not be as attributable so like the ability to actually map back to every single dollar spent is a little bit harder but it doesn't mean that it's not impactful and I think as a company scales you have to invest in both and ideally they work really really well together like the more you invest in brand marketing it strengthens your performance marketing this goes back to like having enough creative to even test if you're too limited in scope and you don't have a brand you feel like you can actually amplify your handicapping your ability.You don't actually have a good performance marketing program I love that heuristic of how do you know if you are under invested in brand is if you're limited in the number of ideas you can try in.Performance marketing like is or your totally is your design system just like is everyone having to redesign things from scratch and come up with all these frameworks every time they run an ad exactly, Yeah, yeah, it's like basically you kind of have a feeling for, you know, if I were to scale this up to a thousand pieces of creative, would it still feel cohesive or is it kind of all over the place and it feels like it's all over the place and you kind of have to go back to the drum.

You said when you talked about the rebrand that it took a lot longer than you expected that it was more expensive than you expected, that's like the fear I think everyone has when they hear this like oh I don't have time for a rebrand I also imagine because your product is so visual that it makes more sense to invest there and to spend the time and money for the typical founder do you have any just I don't know thoughts of just like here's when it makes sense Here's a sign you really need to invest here heavily versus like and it'll probably be all right Yeah I mean I do think it's probably more gear.to anything that's a little bit more proumer or consumer because so much of your product you're trying to create this feeling for a user, like what are they experiencing and the experience happens way before they even drop into your product it might be they see an ad or they see a billboard or they see something as like okay that piqued my interest a little bit and then you need some sort of like symmetric messaging and that they see there's a some symmetry in that they see the ad, then they drop into the product with land on your website.。it feels cohesive and it feels like okay is this is interesting I'm going to go all the way through to sign up and then maybe actually start using the product that's a little bit different when it's like a B2B product or you know where there's there isn't as much reliance on know that initial moment they might just hear about it through you know colleague and then sign up for it and then go through huge procurement process then it's like okay maybe it matters but probably not so much as as like for a product where the brand can have so many different touch points I want to talk about some.Kind of broader things that have worked to help you grow. but before we do that, I just want to visualize the pie chart of how gammock rows, say post 10 million air are if I have it correctly in my head, it's over 50% just word of mouth organic people sharing it doing presentations for each other oh's yeah I go check it up I know then it feels like the second biggest bucket is.Influencer marketing kind of social stuff and then is the third performance slash paid marketing.Yeah, that's right. Yeah, cool. So on that last piece, is there anything else there for people that are starting to explore performance marketing,Essential Facebook ads, Google ads, all these other platforms. I there anything else that you think might be helpful for people to hear or learn just to get started down this road. I I would just have two recommendations like one going back to my initial piece of advice, which is.😊。Don't invest until you have word of mouth don't fool yourself into thinking that you'll solve other problems by just starting to ramp up a performance marketing program, like just get the word of mouthpiece first so that you have you're coming into this program with some tailwinds and then start ramping it up.The second piece is like set some constraints, you don't want your product to be at a point where more than 50% of your acquisitions are coming through paid acquisition, I think if that is happening.Your core growth engine is broken and feeds right back to point number one, which is that if your core growth engine is broken, you just have this leaky bucket, you're trying to spend so much money building top of the funnel, people are not making it all the way through something else should be fixed before you really try to dial it up and it doesn't mean like you don't spend a little bit of money but just don't dial it up until you feel like your core growth engine is actually working.。When you said the first point about weight until you have word of mouth before investing in performance marketing, is that essentially like a large chunk of your growth should be coming from word of mouth direct organic yeah and for us even at scale again going back to more than 50% of new signups still come through word of mouth like we that for us as a sign up okay something is still working people are using the product telling other people and you want that feeling before you really start dialing anything else though is there like a percentage that you think is helpful for people to.about just like is it like 25% or more something like that of just word of mouth for you to feel like okay, we actually have organic growth as a major growth engine Yeah, I mean, I think this comes back to maybe just how maybe aggressive you want to be you know I think just rough you know heuristic is the more the better if it's over 50% I think that's great if it's like approaching that good and just going back to like don't fool yourself into thinking just ads is going to be the way you grow because you can do that but everything else becomes harder and harder if you.Rely on paid acquisition to be the main growth engine, you should be prepared for things like CAC, like customer acquisition costs to keep going up.And the more you're trying to reach like a new audience it gets more and more expensive so don't assume it's going be flat and then all of a sudden you're running on this treadmill that's actually running faster and faster and so that's where it's easy to get hooked on that early on when you're just investing a small amount of money and then it's almost impossible to get off that treadmill when you're too far into it so anticipate that and give yourself a better chance at actually be able to sustain that growth long term important advice.Okay, there's a couple more elements you've shared that were key to gamma's growth, one is sharing prototypes with users before you ship.What does that look like, what does that mean why is that so powerful Yeah, I mean, this for us was a huge unlock you know, going back to like early days when you're just trying to get your product into anybody's hands, you're getting to your you know friends trying to use it and again they're going to lie to you tell you how great it is and then never come back to using the product I think what you want to be able to do you know the ideal situation is you recruit a bunch of people that could you know they are legitimately good prospective users or customers of your product but have zero skin in the game.

They do not care at all whether or not your product succeeds they're just in it to test it and you you know for us it was like people to have made slide decks or make slide decks regularly, let's drop them into gamma, give them very little context we just tell you hey this is an alternative to PowerPoint, go ahead and try it And then as you're going through the onboarding flow and testing the product just tell us everything that's going on your head like describe what you're seeing, tell us what you're trying to do, we'll give you maybe a few different tasks like oh create you know create a piece of content.And when you watch them do that and also hear what they're saying, you just immediately feel the pain.Like all the places they're struggling and all the places are so confused by like what they're seeing and you sort of then can internalize that pain and say okay we're going back and we have to fix this this is like not usable like we you we oftentimes are dog fooding everything and so you can get to the point where you're so familiar with your own product everything kind of feels kind of easy and you know where things are but when you start actually hearing other people describe their usage of the product that's like a gift like you're all of a sudden you're like okay now I know we to actually spend the time.arren't even getting to the third screen they're stuck on the first screen because they can't even find the button that we think is like so dead obvious as so let's go back and actually re-engineer, rearchect that piece of it and we've done that for everything landing pages, onboarding experience, new feature launches, export sharing every single piece of that such that you know we can actually see where things are working or not, and then every time we'll learn something that's kind of painful but obvious that we need to fix and we go back and fix it.。How do you scale this sort of thing, How do you run every new big idea and new feature change by people. Do you have like a closed beta group, do use some platform how do you actually do this There's a couple great platforms So voice panel, which is also YC company full disclosure angel investor And then there's also you know platforms like user testing that really help you source and find find these people that fit again that persona or profile you're looking for. So in our case like people that are.specific job function or createate decks regularly and so you can use those platforms to really scale up these programs pretty fast and then once your team knows how to use those platforms like we would have an idea in the morning and in the afternoon we're already running you a pretty full scale experiment or like you know a research study and by the evening or by the next day we can actually go through all of it together so it's pretty fast once you have it set up it's more about like how do you get the program onboarded the right way I think the other sort of mechanism we did early,was once we had some repeat users, we created sort of a program for our power users, we called it the Gabassador program, which is we put put them into a separate slackla workspace and that was a place for us to kind of share very, very early prototypes like wire wireframes, sometimes are functional prototypes and get them to get get some initial feedback as well, this definitely helps with more sort of later stage or like features or things that aren't going to be necessarily important was part of,Onboarding but like once you understand gamma like how do you share it for instance, like this was a great way to start testing some of that because they already understand gamma, but now you're adding net new functionality and then we you can also watch them struggle and hear how they're struggling with the product and so that has been a great way just to have a separate slackck workspace anytime we're thinking about something they're the first to hear about it give us an early indication if we're on the right track or not I love this workflow that you shared you have an idea in the morning you build a prototype do you built it with like like AI.Tyie tools like cursor, lovable something like that.Yeah, yeah that or it could be, yeah I mean, we're lucky a lot of our you know designers also not a code so even before the recent tools like kind of come up with some sort of functional prototype and then be able to ship that so people can start playing with it Yeah, so you you have an idea in the morning, you build a prototype using various tools you by the end of the day you are getting feedback from real people using one of these platforms' voice panel or user testing.And just like that loop saves you, I imagine potentially months of just building the thing nobody wants and shipping it, launching it and then just failing totally.Yeah, I mean, I think this is even more probably helpful for, you know, certainly a lot of folks that are starting to do much with Vibecode apps like yeah that's great like you've lowered the you know amount of time to get something out there now prove that it's useful to like some set of users and this should be again like every day every week you should be able to go through a ton of these and then build on the things that seem to be working I feel like that's like it's almost like a way to speedrun a lot of that early sort of you're the idea amazedze, you think you have something that could kind of work.How do you actually break through so that, you know, people are actually finding value in what you're building Yeah, I love it because so many people hear this idea of just like run your stuff by users before you ship, you know, do the user research, it sounds so.😊Hard and heavy lift E and in the way you're describing it is like very automated, very, very quick to do, you don't have to go think about finding random people in a coffee shop, It's just like these platforms exist where you could go plug in your thing, get feedback by the end of the day.Totally, yeah. and that, yeah, helps you just move way faster. Is there a feature that you were're super excited about that you built in ranm through this and just like, okay, that was a huge failure. I, I, I don't think any of the ones where we, you know, we always try to kind of.😊Chunk it down.

Ths we're testing earlier on or like these massive features. they're always like an inception or like a starting point of like this could be something interesting. And then we take that initial learning and actually then build the product around it. It's never like oh we spent four months work on this thing let's see if anybody actually wants it. It's almost like we always start super early and a bunch of ideas die right away but they're still pretty small ideas and then the ones that kind of pass the initial tests you start building towards something that could be hopefully more gamechan or much more value add and by the time you're actually shipping like you've gone through.10 different layers of actually testing and iteration before it actually sees the light of day what's really interesting about you and the way your company operates you guys are X optimizely people say you're very.Vers at experimentation, a lot of people talk about B testingest experimentation as something that doesn't make sense for a startup because the scale is so low What I'm hearing here and know this is something you talk about is just there is actually a lot of way to a lot of ways to think experimentally even in the early stages is there something more there you think is important for people to hear Yeah, I mean I really think it's more of you know the mindset you go into to almost any problem or opportunities, you know the saying of strong opinions.I think it's totally fine to have like some of these assumptions or like hypotheses going into a lot of these things, but you should always know that there's a way to start trying to validate some of this you as a founder, you're always trying to build conviction and so you build conviction by not having it all live in your head but getting it out there and start testing this with users, prospect customers and starting of see like what are the things that actually feel right and sometimes you have enough data to be statistically significant sometimes it's more of a hey, we at least were able to gutchuck this.A bit and gets some qualitative feedback I think that's still valuable it shouldn't be this sort of like all or nothing like oh has to be stats safe for it to be useful I don't think that's true in fact i'll just share kind of the very early story of you know when we first started gamma we knew we wanted to help change the way people communicate and we actually had two different ideas we were parallel path kind of at the same time so of course we had presentations reimagining how people were creating presentations and we actually had the separate idea which we called.？The lobby which is a virtual office this is a place where you know this is again peak pandemic, much more hybrid work, much more virtual work and so this was a place where everybody on the team whether you're in the same office or not could gather collaborate to feel pretty magical and we worked on both for six months we worked on both the virtual office and the presentation product for six months we would dog food both so like oftentimes we would be in the virtual office presenting the presentation tool and kind of use both.。And after six months we came to this conclusion that we wanted to go all in on the presentation tool and the reason was when we looked at the virtual office tool we were sort of always competing against what we thought was something wed never be able to surpass, which is in real life experience like actually being able to work shoulder, shoulder with your colleagues and having this environment where you know you really feel like you're building together, like virtual office could get pretty good, but we would never beat that and so we were almost like limited in our own imagined.About how good could this product be versus.The presentation product, we ended that with like a million more ideas we thought we could actually introduce that could be better than how you work in PowerPoint today and we were just so so energized by it and so for us that was like you know this sort of AP test of like testing these two things that we invested equal amount of time into and coming out at the other end realizing that one was going to be the product we were pour sort of all of our blood sweat and tears into making it great because we saw the potential in it I didn't know that about you guys.Explore that other idea that there's so many startups that did that during CoVID times. I'm like, okay, this is the future are all gonna be remote. and let's work remotely And virtual offices. there's a startup and I'm a tiny investor in Ldy that is now a big AI agent company and they did the same thing. I imagine, you know, that was their whole first concept.😊It was just like these little avatars, it was like a little game where you walk around go to little Christian virtual we had some yeah, it was, it was a fun product to work on so, but yeah.Yeah, it's interesting how we just reverted to the base back to like the mean of just like yeah people are in offices again. that was a fun fun experience. although things have changed. So just to highlight this point you made that I think is really powerful. I haven't heard it describe this way before. just the power of testing prototypes, very, very, very early using these platforms that make it super easy. We always hear. Okay, you have you have a mock. you have a prototype. Yeah, test about users always feels like this heavy thing you gotta.😊use the research team, go do interviews, do one on ones like what you're describing is something I don't know why everyone's not doing this and with AI tools it's so easy now have an idea build the prototype tested with, I don't know, is it like dozens of people, how many people actually run through a prototype on average?20 20 people, so 20 people look at this thing give you a bunch of feedback, you realize this was very dumb or here's the nugget that we want to lean into and instead of building a thing instead of doing all these user research sessions, things like that super cool.Okay, is there any other big lesson or lever that has helped you grow?To today is $100 million Er $2 billion company, we talked about influencer marketing, we talked about testing product.

Types investing in brand and a little bit of paid growth, anything else. Certainly for us, the ability to sort of adapt and move fast in this environment. You know, I attribute a lot of, you know, what we've been able to accomplish to a few things. One is we do have a small team and a lean team, one that's able to move really fast. I think that is that means by, by default, like we have to look for a lot of levers where a small team can do a lot of different things. So we' can talk one, you know, obviously about like.How do you construct like a team like ours and what I think has worked and then two going back to experimentation being this sort of thing where.For us it's been a huge unlock because it allows you to not only test things and iterate a ton, it allows you to build much more efficiently and so we've been in a startup where we've had great unit economics from the very beginning we run profitably we have really strong margins, I don't think that would be possible if experimentation was in kind of core infrastructure to us because the temptation would be you just throw the most expensive model at every job and assume that's going to work and the reality is that never is the case.For us to be able to actually test across 20 different models in production today, always trying to align kind of value we're delivering to our customers with you our ability to actually scale this operation that's been at the sort of in the background and not always things that are easily quantifiable or things that you're sharing broadly but it is kind of core to our DNA and again going back to a team that came from optim you know probably not surprising but I do think that's been part of our sort of ability to actually execute at this level and I love the product.It's so beautiful and such a good experience, It's such a good example of experimentation and being really obsessed with any experiment A B test like your data can create really beautiful products and experiences that aren't just feeling like some a kind of micro optimizetimized totally yeah and just going back to like one part of the team of the plays a huge role, which is, you know you want to build a product you know people talk about taste and you know brand and all these things are they em mode I'm not gonna kind of kind of and whether or not yes or no.😊I do think it makes a difference and for us at some point you more than a quarter of our team or about a quarter of our team was product designers and I think that's like sort of unintuitive level of investment or at least that's not common like you don't see many startups like out our stage or early stage where a quarter of the teams product designers and I think that was an important investment for us because when you think about with AI companies, so many companies are trying to invent new surface areas or new user experiences.And that's not possible if you're not really getting the foundation right right really thinking deeply about user problems and how can you solve them in a novel way and so for us, like we made that investment in the very beginning, even if it was counter to what other startups would do because we actually felt like it was the right thing Okay, I definitely want to spend more time on hiring before we get to that.。You've touched on this kind of concept that you guys are with many describe a GPT wrapper company, you essentially sit on top of other models, do some cool stuff charge for that there's historically and there's been a big shift here historically there's a sense that okay you're just this thin layer on top of the model, how is there any sort of motor leverage or long-term business model here when it's just the model that is doing the thing and charging you guys.To do all this AI work.It feels like people have started to realize maybe that is where all that is the only place money will be made because the models are just so hard to compete with and that's not a place you can build a business anymore talk about just what you've learned about this concept of being a GPT rapper and how maybe what people may not be understanding about the business opportunity there you know when you think about maybe just literally only being a wrapper on like one model or one provider maybe there's only limited amount of utility or value add but then,When you start thinking about, okay I'm going to go really deep into this one workflow and it's not just one model, it's maybe 20 plus models powering all different parts of the product, and then you're thinking about the orchestration that's required and you're thinking about obviously if you're experimenting constantly being able to test across the newest models versus models that have been around that are cheaper you're doing a lot really your job is to again like align value, maximize the value you're delivering to the end user.In a way that's sustainable for you as a business and so there's a lot more to that and so for us we've always been passionate about being very close to our customers, our users who for them, their job to be done is visual communication, visual storytelling and the default tool today is going into like a PowerPoint or Google Slides where the amount of effort to create something you we've all been there late at night trying to format a deck trying to find the right layout, all this manual and tedious work well what if you could abstract all that away.And give them something that feels a little bit more delightful, a little bit easier, much more effortless what would that earn you in terms of a customer that wants to come back to your product and so that's everything that we focus on is like you need to go deep into the workflow be empathetic to the user and their job that you're trying to solve and of course apply the best technology possible so that you're delivering on that promise of a product experience way better than the status quo and I think if you can be laser focused on it doesn't matter if you're a rapper or not.

What is the technology you're doing in applying that makes a real difference So thats that's the ultimate goal This is a really cool framework for how to think about what it takes to build a successful raper company that is I don't know let's just I'll keep using that term I don't know if it's structure turn but just like you know some ideas don't work because these model companies are launching their own products here and there So what I love about what you're describing here is kind of like almost like a heuristic that'll tell you if there's if there's an opportunity slash how to be successful.As a G rapper company, I'm putting in air quotes, it sounded like maybe there's three here, but talk about just like if you think about the bullet points of what you need to do to build a successful business on top of existing models I mean, I think the most important thing is know before we even talk about the technology So' we're skipping to the part where you're trying to know apply the most interesting models or technology to solve some problem start with solving the problem you actually care about, you know, I think it's very tempting right now to chase China.Ojects like a founder might be able to gain some initial traction by literally being that GT rapper and like solving any sort of problem and like you start to see some traction and then you just go with that but before you do that you should think about is this a problem I can invest five to10 years it actually solving do I care deeply enough about it because if you can't you're never going to go sort of actually think about like overcoming the variety of different hurdles whether it's other startups or other incumbent tools that are trying to start doing the same thing and so for us like?Go back to like you know we've started this company because we really care about helping change the way people communicate their ideas, we really feel like this idea of like visual communication, visual storytelling matters it helps elevate everybody and it gives people much more opportunity to do the things that in the past if you weren't great at making slides your ideas might have died and someone else that was able to actually articulate their ideas better, ended up winning the deal or winning the favor of their manager or their boss and so we felt like that was,know that doesn't feel right and so could we help democratize visual storytelling, visual communication that was sort of our North star and then you go back into thinking okay every step of the way what are the tools and technology I can apply to help solve that and actually move the average person closer to that longter vision of ours and of course AIs been again like this gift where yes you can apply that to solving this job, you can also apply that AI to many different jobs, figure out what is the problem you care deeply enough to go deep.Because going back to this sort of idea like you need to own the sort of end- to end workflow, a customer needs to have you like you want you to live, you want your product to live in their brain somewhere where when they think abouty, I have to create a presentation, they come to you as a default tool and the moment they start creating it to the moment they ship it and send it to their boss, that end to end experience needs to feel magical and needs to feel great and I don't think you can really do that unless it's actually a workflow, you either know deeply yourself or you care deeply to actually help.All for somebody else. So some of the elements I'm hearing here is one is just like.Care actually really care about solving this problem, not come from, oh, wow, this cool thing happened and it worked. wow, maybe I could sell this thing to people because you may end up having to work on this thing for 10,20 years.Two is understand the problem really, really deeply and have real empathy for the people trying to solve this problem you have this problem that you creating presentations at your previous job so you understood it and I imagine you understand even more deeply now that you work on this sos essentially like care really deeply go really deeply on the problem and have real empathy for the people facing this problem and then there's this like actually be able to solve this problem using the technology out there and you made this point about how you guys use 20 different.Moels to do what you do.Talk a little bit more about that just because you know people may think oh okay like I could just go open to chat to Bt or cloud and it'll create an awesome presentation for me Why does it take 20 different models Why is that such a big part of the success here Yeah, so going back to the workflow you know you're trying to go and break down every step of you know the creation process for a user so the moment of the initial idea to maybe creating an outline of what you want to present or articulate to creating the first draft like what do we show you there to editing.The content like okay I have a first draft but it's only 60% of the way there how do I get it to 100% of the way there those are all things that might require different models like the initial outline might be better served by something that's purpose built for actually creating you know the best outline the best narrative, the best story arc versus one where you're actually going back and saying you know gamma our agent can actually go and review your entire deck and say actually if I were to add suggestions I would say you know you may want want to change the visual layout on these set of cards.？And you may want to actually change the imagery or the visuals for these cars to match know everything else these are things that again like every model might be better serve for different things and so knowing how that actually breaks down into the end user sitting down working on the product working on working on you know their presentation how do you help them I think you can only do that by understanding that workflow and then breaking that down into finding the right tool for the right job that is super interesting essentially there's like here's the things that AI has to do for us I don't know imagining some.Of a storyboard, and then it's figure out the model and level of model and prompt for that model to achieve each of these steps as best as possible.

。Totally yeah and it applies to you know even on the visual side finding the right image, I think certain models of great at photorealistic output versus others you know want more of the artistic vibe or like you know something that feels more abstract and so again you can choose the right model for the right job it doesn't mean that you'll never use the other models is just like as you're going through that workflow the content might dictate what's the best use case so in that particular know particular use case and so you're always trying to map to that what is the end user trying to.complish in that certain moment. Which models are you finding most useful in in the work Like, I don't know, is there anything surprising about, oh, wow, this model is actually really good at this. And this is really bad at that.Yeah, I think surprising or not surprising the leader board is constantly changing and so this is where you almost you have to have the mindset that you can be adaptable, we're just getting to the point where there's going to be more personalization to he going back to like you know a consultant is going to have different needs in an educator if educator is trying to engage their students they might want to have you know language or visuals are more animated and that makes sense consultant can't get away with that they might need something that you know is much more structured or information dense and so.Again like how do we actually be the same tool that can serve both of those needs I think that's where it becomes interesting and it's almost like there is isn't necessarily even a quote unquote best model it's like what's the right model for that for that particular user that's actually much harder problem to solve and we're just starting to trying to embrace some of that now I there one that's just like oh that's actually really cool for some that way to early on things like creating the outline perplexity was actually great not one that people talk about is often but creating the outline and doing web search and actually integrating.Those elements together for us was was pretty powerful They're okay, there's two more things I want to talk about one is pricing how you guys figured out your approach to pricing you guys started monetizing really early and that feels like such an important piece to AI startups because you're spending real money on an inference and other things and then I want to talk about hiring So in terms of pricing.Yeah.When did you decide it was time to really start charging and then how did you pick your approach to pricing your actual price Yeah so we kind of stumbled into having to do pricing and packaging I mentioned our big AI launch in March 2023 this was pre revenueevenue so we wanted just to get the you know we focused all of our effort on the first 30 seconds literally all hands on deck just trying to get that right and we spent zero time on actually monetization so we you know we had a credit system.All new users get 400 credits once they burn through those credits there's actually nothing more you could do with AI it kind of just cut off and so intercom for us was just blowing up with people saying how do I purchase more credits like I want to keep using this thing in a very fair question so basically all of April we ended up having to do a quick you know sort of pricing and packaging exercise we did a couple of different things we did run a form of Van Wesenddorp which is just understanding what is the overall wildness to play.We us to pay and so we did use that, we did kind of integrate some forms of like conjoin analysis which is just like trying to understand what are the features or things that people actually value in your product and so we'd survey a lot of our early users and kind of ended up coming to a price point that was in the beginning we only had one plan type was roughly like 20 bucks a month part of this was also just realizing we almost didn't need to overthink it too much because this is when the initial wave of like AI companies and startups are coming out and products were coming out.And you almost end up becoming anchored by what is ChayBT charge because everyone becomes familiar with that price point and so we asked ourselves like how complicated do we want to make it, we always default to remove friction make it as easy as possible for a user to understand and so we end up coming up with like a similar price point and kind of ship that as the V1 basically end of May 2023 and for us we wanted to see a couple things like okay we have the initial price point, is it economical for us like at that price point or we actually making money?い？And we'd monitor there for that for many, many months realizing that yes, like actually at that price point, we could still generate pretty good margins and that would allow us to reinvest that profit back into growing the business continue to add you know obviously headcount, but then also you know investing even more and to inference costs whatever we wanted to do to experiment broadly with AI and so we've always had that like you know.。Pricing and packaging is not only it doesnt not only need to be easy to understand for a user you know obviously you have to have like strong conversion rates, but it should be something where you feel like you could build an enduring durable business off of and if it's not right then you can always go back and try to tweak things but it's something you should be monitoring as early as possible What's interesting we have the head of chat on the podcast and he shared the way they picked Chas prices the Western Dork survey that they ran in Google forms yeah I listened to that one Yeah its a great one what.That survey man what a and not only just that survey being the its like I'm imagining that XKCD comic with like the open source little I don't know block holding up the entire world like this one little piece of code, that's like the survey just like behind everything but it's interesting how that one decision just created this ripple effect on all AI startups 20 bucks a month of course that's what everyone's doing.who knows what would happen if they chose a different number, but right everyone be so much more rich if it's just like 25 bucks someone imagine that.

The GDP of growth.From that oh man okay and then the way so is Ben West Enddorp helped you pick a price point and then you said this conjoint analysis actually I have a guest post that I think describes how to do this well and if not we'll find point people to actually approach this and you started charging so post product cut launch you launch with no paid features people are just like I want to pay I want tona keep using this you're like okay I guess we gotta start charging.Yeah.That's right. Yep, is there anything looking back, I guess just like you'd wish you'd known when you were approaching pricing for folks that are doing this now like oh, we should have done this differently or should have thought about this. Yeah, I mean that's that one's hard, I think you know you never want to obviously just throw something together without giving it much thought, but for us.。You with limited resources, we focused on the only thing we thought mattered, which was like getting some initial users and having that organic growth and I think there's maybe like two checkpoints of thinking about whether or not you feel like you have product market fit I think one checkpoint is organic growth the second is are people willing to pay for the product and I think if you pass both those you feel like you've at least within some pocket of the market you have some PMF so I think those are both important questions to ask depending on your resources ideally.Do kind of both and experiment a little bit along, you know, at the same time and then by the time you actually have paying users you' you sort of check some of those boxes for yourself by the way, I love the j like you launch pricing you're like okay, let's figure out if we're actually making money or not it's not obvious with AI companies.。Well, we also didn't have a choice because at that point, runway was also low, you know, So it's like if we weren't making money, well, you know, we would actually be in a tough spot. That's such a good point that you did not have a huge amount of money sitting around to spend on like the way a lot of companies in AI do just well deal with it and we'll figure out how to make money later. To, yeah, within a couple months, we had hit a million in A and became profitable. And so those were both two exciting milestones for a company that months prior were, you know heads down figuring out how we we.survive What a story. I'm so excited to be telling the story. Okay, final topic. I want to talk about is hiring. You have some really hot takes on hiring. Clearly, it's worked out for you guys. What are some things you've learned about hiring Well, What is your approach to hiring. Yeah, so we had this mantra internally, I mean, even before, you know, the the sort of AI launch for us, which was higher painfully slowly.😊嗯。And I think you know the temptation is once start you things start working, you just start blooditzscaling this thing and start adding more and more headcount and for us that always I don't know, they didn't feel right, we wanted to build the team very thoughtfully be lean but also be a team that every individual feels like they have high amount of impact that they can that they have on a daily basis and and so for us yeah that was from sort of the very beginning and so even you know as we've scaled up I think we've been super efficient by nature of just being a very lean team.So I think a lot of people here this advice to stay, be efficient. you have some even more concrete pieces of advice here of just like what that looks like, you have a huge, I don't know philosophy of just like huge leverage per person. you focus a lot on revenue per employee talk about that. So we actually I mean we obviously we look at things like revenue per employee but we never let that be the sort of North star. It's not something that dictates our strategy per se same thing with like profitability, I think by being efficient like that ends up becoming like a side effect of.we are profitable and growing but I think for us more of is like we care a ton about you know adding the right team members so you know it' it's easy, you can almost sort of shoot yourself in the foot as a founder by just setting the wrong goals if your goal is to double and headcount and like add 100 people to the company then that becomes the goal right the goal is no longer to add the best people is no longer to maintain a high qualityality bar the goal is to hit 100 people and that's everything everyone's focused on so then guess what if that's the goal and the thing that ends up dropping is okay maybe.Settle for employees that are good enough.And we're going to make sure we get to that hundred because hundred is going to help us get to the next phase of growth and then the next phase of growth and I think we've tried to resist that temptation, which is we want everybody that comes through the door and joins our team to to really be you know the type of person that represents gamma Our first 10 to 12 employees we spend so much time like really getting the DNA right I think Brian Chesky talks about this like your goal is like you get that first 10..And you want to be able to then replicate the next 10 and then replicate the next 10, but that 10 needs to be all super cohesive, you need to have the shared same shared values, same principles, same ambitions, same vision, and if you don't, then like what are you even replicating right at that point you're just adding headcount and you know you can easily just be adding headcount because they're chasing the next shiny startup to join.And so for us, we really focused on that first 10, that allows us to really have this you know this sort of community of like a teammates that basically want to stick around.A lot of founders think about not wanting to have a leaky bucket on the product side, but the same thing applies on the team size right if you have a leaky bucket people are just constantly leaving revolving door that's a huge amount of cost the continuity costs is massive and it's really hard to quantify and I mentioned our first 10 employees all 10 of them are still here today five years later so that sort of continuity means that you have this tribal knowledge that sticks with you it means that people.

Continue building and having that sort of cohesive feeling. So I think that's one piece just like, it's hard to quantify. But I do think you know, startups, I would advise just really be thoughtful about that. Like, get that to a point where you really feel confident that as you're adding the next 10 and next hundred, you're actually replicating the same DNA and not actually just adding a bunch of random people to the company..One of your very specific piece of advice is hired generalists versus someone that's just like really deep in one thing why is that so important, what does that look like This very much feels like the age of the generalist or the rise of the generalist right now when we think about you know a team that can be really flat you want people that can you still want people that can be very spiky in certain areas so for instance, obviously you know a product designer that knows how to code that's great. It allows you to actually span across many different domains and.And an organization that's super flat when you're wearing a lot of different hats, that means every individual if you're a generalist you can wear by default, a lot of different hats, and that's helped us like just maintain this idea that the work the opportunity in front of us continues just expand each person plays a huge role they don't need to wait and ask for permission they can go after and pick up a piece of work because it's there and they can at least get it started even if they're not the one that always sees it through and so for us I do think this rise of the generalist is going to be important, you can always augment that by work.With contractors or agencies that are hyper specializedized in certain areas and this is where like for instance going back to influencer marketing, you might work with an agency rather than kind of scale up your own influencer marketing team you work with like hyper specializedized team there but my marketing team is all generalists you know we our head of marketing more recently launched this cool drone show in San Francisco we had like 4000 people in San Francisco co the mayor came by she created that entire project a manage.Project and Hen or herself right while also managing the entire marketing team and so it's like this idea that a generalist is able to play all these different roles can still you know be super high impact for us it also goes hand in hand with I mentioned sort of this other role which is the player coach traditional management layer is like a manager manages a ton of people and that's kind of their core focus all of our people leaders are player coaches and that they still do the end work themselves.And they can like mentor and coach those around them This analogy came from or this mindset came from's something borrow from just the sports world in general because there's a lot of sports that just move incredibly fast like football for instance, it moves really really fast and so you might have a coach that's calling in a play but the quarterback can actually make a last minute and adjustment based on what he's seeing the defense do right and so you want a player that is on the field that can adapt as needed and that way the coach doesn't have to call every single thing in he's just kind of giving you the general intent.Of what you want to run as the play and then the quarterback quarterback could still make the adjustments and so all of our people leaders our management where is all folks that actually can make those adjustments if they're seeing something that doesn't feel right.On a daily or weekly basis, they're kind of adjusting priorities for that team and they're still doing the work themselves too they're so close to that they understand like what is a relative prioritization at all times. So both of those I think haveve been you know when I think about founders they oftentimes think about innovation in the sense like we're going to innovate on products or innovate on technology. I think every founder today has a chance to innovate on org design and that starts by just thinking about what is the type of company we want to build today.What does it mean and when it comes to like the management later what what sort of leaders do we hire, what does it mean when it comes to hiring specific roles and specific functions, all that is a chance for you to be very thoughtful and build a company that you're excited to be at for hopefully many, many years to come So what I'm hearing here is manager, there's no peer managers again when your plan is to not have people that are just managing the ideas everyone, even a manager is doing their own IC work.Yes, and then the other piece of advice here is just generalists people that can do a lot of stuff and I hear this a lot on this podcast just like everyone is there's no more just like you're a designer that's all you're going do designers need to build stuff market stuff.Write some PRRDs probably. And I think, I mean, just one thing to add is like, you know, that's for where we are, where where we are at today.I think being adaptable means that you know certain things may evolve and change and like how the player coach model evolves, you know maybe in certain functions or as the team scales like that's not going to be practical everywhere and I think the reality is like you just have to know and be willing to kind of adopt like different frameworks over time and like being honest with herself with what's working what's not I think we're constantly trying to learn and evolve ourselves because I think we're doing it in a way that we don't believe it really has been done before and so we have to kind of pave our own path over time.I love that. giving yourself an out when when the time comes when you need to just hire managers a year later, when you invite me back and say, yeah, this what we learned. Yeah, you know, that makes sense. That's probably gonna happen. It's like people are like, we don't need product managers and then. Okay, I see. maybe we do. yeah, that makes sense.😊One last piece I want to talk about is you have this really cool quote that you shared on Twitter, when you find someone exceptional, be big on them.This a big part of your philosophy is just like be big on the people that are doing super well. to talk about what that looks like and why that's so important. Yeah, I mean, this starts top of the funnel, which is like you meet candidates you decide who.

You actually hire and so if you don't start with a high bar there, you know going back to what is the goal of the goals to hit a hiring target versus like you know maintaining a super high quality hiring bar those are different goals and I don't think we've ever kind of dropped our bar and so then you bring somebody in that you think is exceptional that brings something unique to the table that can be a good teammate when they when they're thriving you just given more and more resources.系。I think what you realize going you know another sports analogy is like you know you're when you're on an a team for instance, or a team that you feel like is exceptional, you know a players want actually more playing time like you never see a star player that says actually want less playing time, they want more time on the field, they want to actually go after the hardest problems, they want to be able to feel like they're making a huge impact and so if you have fewer exceptional teammates where you can just throw almost anything at them and they'll figure it out that feels for you know you as a team.fes great because then they get what they find rewarding which is the ability to go after hard hairy problems and to be able to come out throughout that their end feeling like they've accomplished something and I think that for us has always been something that goes beyond just you know almost everything else like we give people a chance to really thrive in this environment and we try to nurture that as much as humanly possible every step of the way iss there anything else around hiring that you think is really important or a big lesson you've learned or lesson you share that.That we haven't talked about yet I mean, there's some of these intangibles which is, you know for the founding team, does this feel like this could be your life's work right like when you're pitching when you're pitching a potential candidate like does this feel like something where you're actually committed the unfortunate side of a lot of the you know what's happening in the AI world broadly is I think you're coming to learn which founders are sort of missionaries versus mercenaries and many that were just chasing maybe just a big outcome where like something shiny or like something to feel good.themselves they'll go off and then the company you know I guess doesn't live on or maybe has to find a different way, a different path and so you know something I admire is like you look at some of the founders obviously before this sort of AI era, you know folks like Dylan or Melanie Figma Canva,。You know I've been at notion they've been doing this for over a decade now they had many chances to just you leave and you know sunset off into doing whatever they want to do but they care so much about the mission they've stuck it through and I think when you're talking to candidates candidates can kind of tell like is this something like the founders even care about and I think you're gonna to have a better chance of attracting you know true missionaries people that want to build with you for the long haul if it's authentic and it's something you actually care about Oh man I feel like I keep saying this I feel like.You can have at least five more hours of stuff to talk about that'll be good content for when you come back and you're making a billion dollars a year.Before we get to our very exciting lightning round grant, is there anything else that you think is important for people to hear any last, I don't know less you want to double down on anything you want to leave listeners with Yeah, I mean just going back to the original story of that was probably the ultimate low point, you know having an investor that spent 20 minutes listening to my pitch telling me that it was the worst thing worst idea in the world, you know I think throughout the journey there's gonna to be those low moments and when I think about you know being a founder.And working on a startup, you're honestly just trying to increase your luckx surface area as much as possible, and for me luck surface area has two dimensions The first dimension is people.Who are you surrounding yourself with that share your same ambition, share the same values, same principles?And find those people and then give yourself enough time to prove that you guys can, you know accomplish great things. I'm lucky to have two amazing co-founders. we've been working on this thing for five years. There's 0% chance we'd be where we are if I didn't have them and we've had to overcome a lot, but I guess for us, it's like creating that own luck over a longtime horizon has been the only way that you know it's been possible. Well, it's clearly showing in the success you guys are having.Grant with that we've reached our very exciting lightning ground are you ready Yes, all right, I've got five questions for you first question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?I..Yeah so I'll give one that's for pre-product market fit folks and the one postproductfit preproduct market fit I'd say is Shodog, which is written by Phil Knight, founder of Nike and you know he talks about two things like one you should chase your sort of crazy ideas but are these should be ideas you're passionate about like he was an athlete and so not surprisingly he focused a lot about you know creating tools or you know shoes in this case for other athletes and was passionate about that.。And the second thing he taught me was going back to the team thing, he surrounded himself with other people that were super passionate about athletics and shoes as well, and so the folks that he had as has his initial startup crew or all that, and I think that gives you a chance of like overcoming a ton where your focus on problems you actually care about solving you're dealing with a team that shares the same ambition as you postproduct Market Fit there's a book called Seven Powers by Hamilton Helmer where I think when you think about how to build a durableable Business.So much in there. I think there's a lot that you can kind of read and reread as you kind of evolve and kind of hit new milestones yourself and.

Of that can be both tactical, but also like zooming out and think about what are the big picture strategic questions you as a founding team you to be thinking about. So both are great. Hamilton was on the podcast willing to that episode. I also love that book. many people mention it. Next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show You really enjoyed. Yeah, the Lazarus project is one. I'm I'm a huge sucker for time travel and scifi. So this is one I just started watching. and for me, it has like all the right ingredients for a fun show.😊。Is there a product you recently discovered that you really love Yeah, I mentioned this already voice panel So again, a full disclosure angel investor, but we've been using it and going back to kind of being a cheat code for folks that are starting to experiment a ton with different ideas vibe coding maybe some of these like get this into the hands of users here what they think about it I think and honestly can help speed up a lot of things and save you time from wasting time on kind of the wrong ideas or ideas where there's no market there.Life motto that you often find yourself coming back to in work or in life. Yeah, so there' is this Chinese idiom that my mom used to say it's a gene de Zwa, which the translation is frog at the bottom of a well.And the story is like there you know there's a frog at the bottom of the well, he looks up every night and he sees the world and he imagines he knows everything about the world and then one day a bird comes along and describes all the things that he sees the ocean, the mountains and the frog realizes that what he sees is just such a limited part of the world and you know the bird asks like do you want to come join me and kind of see the rest of it so frog goes along and so for me, you know I came from you know pretty modest child.You know my parents we didn't have a whole lot and I think it would have been very easy to kind of have a very narrow kind of lens on the world and be like oh this is this is what it is but my mom never allowed me to do that she always pulled me to dream much bigger to say hey the world is vast it's your opportunity to seize it like you have to go out there don't have a narrow you know view of what's possible, always dream bigger and so for me that's always carried through and every time I feel like I'm thinking too little or too small, I try to zoom out and run.Myself that there's much more out there to go after that is so good and so important and so valuable in today's world where're so much more as possible, just like most of what limits people feels like now is just I don't know what idea I have like I don't know what to do now you could get things done so much quicker and so much more as possible so that's such valuable thinking.Okay, final question.You help people present better, you know, your tools basically help people become better presenters. What's like one tip you've learned or one tip you teach people to become better presenters that might be helpful to listeners. Yeah, I mean, we'll go back to the consumer advertising concept, which is, you know, one idea at a time. So you know this notion of you give them one egg. someone can catch you, give them too many eggs are gonna drop it. So don't try to throw too many concepts all at once, keep it simple. People will.Appreciate it. And so with every sort of presentation, like break it down into the core concepts, try to make sure you're covering one at a time. And I think once you sort of see the through line there, then it becomes easy for it to package up and something that feels more cohesive Le is more, as they say.그.Totally grand two final questions where can folks find you online where can they find gamma, what should they know that's just like plug anything you want and then how can listeners be useful to you Yeah so you can find me on both Twitter and LinkedIn DMs open I honestly here just knowing how hard the journey is in general whether just thinking about a startup idea or you're deep into startup land I want to be hopefully helpful I'm going to be hopefully your biggest cheerleader so let me know I can help and then for us you know world is looking.For feedback, so if you're trying gamma, it's falling short of your expectations, let us know, wed love to help in terms of just trying to make it better and yeah, really appreciate you know all the feedback and support along the way.Gand, this was awesome. I really appreciate you making time I know you're trying to build a crazy fast growing startup a lot going on, so I really appreciate you making time for this Thanks Lanny, it's been a blast it's been a blast for me too bye everyone.Thank you so much for listening if you found this valuable you can subscribe to the show on Apple podcasts, Spotify or your favorite podcast app also please consider giving us a rating or leaving review as that really helps other listeners find the podcast you can find allpastepodes or learn more about the show at Leny'spodcast.com.See you in the next episode.
