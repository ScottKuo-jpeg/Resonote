Yeah, something like that. but we've never seen each other in person. So this is actually the very first time I want to welcome Tomo to the show in the Tomo.😊Yeah.Let the audience know who exactly you are. what you do, and what did you do before the success. Man, So, you know, the my favorite thing about all this is that like we're both excellent enforcement., we have a very similar story., almost in the same timeline., You've been out for a few years. I've been out for a few years. A couple of years longer. I think My road was a little bit more twists and turns, which makes it fun. It's thiss the best stories., So who am I. My name's Tom or Gene.😊First generation American Croatian descent. I just got back from Croatia, by the way, If you haven't been gotta go bro, amazing. I mean, do you see what Tommo was wearing, Reino, I mean, come on. I got came from vacation. I look like I came off a ya because I actually did.We were there for Croatia Yacht week with 50 guys. It was amazing. The network was was sick that was that was with us. love So I'm a wellness entrepreneur. I own, I founded a sprejuvenation clinic. clinic specializes in hormone health, antiging, wellness, basically regenerative preventive medicine, focusing on the hormone, the internal health. We're even getting into stem cells and exosome therapy. Now it's a beautiful thing. we're really healing people from the inside out. We're expanding in the US. We'll have five.😊By the end of the year, we'll have our first international location in Dubai by about mid Novemberve. I love that, man. And you're doing some big things in Dubai right now, man, what what made you go ahead and actually make that move to the Middle East. Dubai is special for me because that's where I got my first part of education when it came to like actual formal education. Obviously, like.Yeah.I'll give you a little bit of backtory. Yeah, I started bodybuilding when I was 13 years old. I started competing when I was 17. Okay, now not to age myself, but I was born 1985. I'm 40 years old. Okay, so not a young young man. But you look great for 40. Thank you appreciate Thank you. if I, if I looked like crap as an antiaging specialist It' be bad I'd be be, man. I'm going to ask guy, I mean, that's what it's for, right, so in 2019, when I first started my clinics.😊Yeah.I went to this education course now I became an autodiect in wellness and antiging and hormones, endocrinology throughout my 20s reading every book manuscript, journal on hormones, on anti aging on wellness because I was bodybuilding, I wanted to do it for myself.Yeah.So it became kind of like a, I don't know, quote unquote expert. an autodiect, right, I became this expert in this field. That's what LED me to transition out of law enforcement to go into the clinics. So I go to the first education course. It was an A4M coach A4M coaching thing with doctor Terry Hertg, one of the O Gs and hormone health and antiging And it was with antiging Association of America A4M. Well, the course happened to be in Dubai. Wow, I took every.Last penny that I had and I even borrowed money from my mother and I said, I'm going to Dubai and I mean, I was so broke that I was not able to properly pay for taxis, which were like $3 to go, you know, back and forth from the gym and whatever while I'm in this education course and I gave this I gave this, you know, training kind of like a a real a real go.And I was kind of highlighted in this group because I was the only non doctor.They're like, who, Why are you here, You're not a doctor, Why are you here, I'm like, I'm a business owner in, you know, the wellness space. They're like, we've never had a business owner do this course before. We don't even know how you got in. Wow, I've done this twice. I've been certified and educated by a 4 M and World link medical. and I'm the only non doctor to do these types of courses because I wasn't supposed to. Well didn't ask for permission I asked for forgiveness afterwards., So got certification. though. So got the education. That's what started me going into Dubai later on. I got.A couple awards. I was a keynote speaker talking about the future of health and wellness and hormones and the business of hormones. and ever since then I've just been, it's always been kind of in the back of my head that the Middle East is really a new land of opportunity, especially the UAE, especially Dubai, that Gcc region.There's a reason that all these exppaths are going there and these people need proper wellness, proper hormone treatment, proper anti aging, because what do rich people want?They want to live forever where they want to feel good. They want to feel good, man. I mean, I'll give from my perspective, man, 2024, it was the best financial year of my life ever. congratulations. the reason why, you know, three different companies have 200 employees. But here's the thing, man.😊Little did anyone know, especially on social media.

Because everybody wants to highlight the best and the best in social media.Is that dude, I fell into deep depression again. I gained about like 50 of weight. Did you really all dude. Yeah, I was, I was fat as hell. I was 50 as. Yeah, dude, it's heavy, bro. Now, if we do a comparison and we'll do it after the show, I mean, I'll show you my book. I'm gonna give you a copy of my book. But you're gonna see it like a fat kid and then me, right, it's night and day, bro.But here's the thing. One thing I will tell you, okay, is that I was able to go ahead and actually find purpose again to go ahead.And feel good. Yeah, why? because I had a really good friend. We have a good mutual friend. We do. Yeah, big Mike. We call him planet Mike. right outside. right outside. He literally ran outside. like always him as you come to coming into the office. be a Russian gentleman. Yeah, the guy looks like Arnold socialcinator. Yeah, So, so anyways, he kept in my year for years because I don't know for about three and a half years from San Diego. dude. for sure.😊But he goes and he said, dude, you really need to focus on your health. How are you driving a Ferrari and you look like that. He's like," no disrespect.But sometimes you guys need friends like that. Ca me chills a little bit You need friends like that. You need friends to tell you the truth. we need to get hit in the mouth, right, So it wasn't until tell him and then a couple of my other friends who are jacked. and they're successful as well. And they were like, dude, come on, you gotta take your house seriously. And then once I got into that.Mental health portion of a dude where I was just like.What's wrong with me. what's wrong with me. So that's why I started taking seriously. So you're absolutely right, dude. And the fact that you're seeing that right now in the Middle East in Dubai and you're like, dude, there's nobody capitalizing what I'm doing over there. Yeah, and it's not even it's not, you know, what's funny people ask me oh you're going to Dubai because of money. you're going Dubai. I'm like, I'm in a place right now, I say this with the most humble intentions. I promise I'm not do this as a flex. No, I don't need to care about money anymore. Yeah, so now I care about impact. purpose purpose fulfill it.That's it. Yeah, So I'm looking at the Middle East because I know I can impact an area that this has not been properly done. And if someone else does it before me, they won't, because I'll be there in November of this year. But if someone else gets there and they're doing a great job, I'm going applaud you. Yeah, I'm just gonna to say, yeah, for' real good. That's what I want. That's what I want to see. You know, but I'm gonna ask you a question.All the money in the world, right, all the money in the world in each city were, you know, overweight, whatever were you getting sick a lot.I was getting sick a lot. Yep, I was sleeping two, three times a day. Yeah, like naps., I was getting headaches, lethargic, just breaking laic. what else, the depression, dude, I was double my medication. I was on prozac. So see this one thing you guys got dude gut health was insane. It was just like, bro, I can never get rid of that chunk. But here, here's the thing, man.I just.Wasn't educated enough. Yeah, right And also you know this from a business perspective and anybody who is a currently in 9 to5 because trust me guys, we come from law enforcement. So we know how it is. We know how it is to probably 9 PM to 5 AM though exactly right You're worse. But the thing is, man, I just didn't want to overcomplicate my life any more than it it was. And that's where I was at dude, I was just like, dude, I'm not trying to educate myself on taking 20 different supplements. I'm not trying to.Go ahead and take the exams. I'm not trying to go ahead and be an expert in fitness dude. I just wanted something more optimized so somebody could go ahead and help me and guess what.D, I build all this money and building all these finances for my family, dude because that's what fulfills me with my family, right, I got my wife got my kid coming on the way beautiful but at the end of the day, dude, you gotta take care of yourself because it wass the point of doing all this and doing impact for the community if you're not willing to help yourself.And, and and that's what I was coming down to. man. It's just like, ultimately, I just lost myself that year. Yeah, I lost myself that year. So then guess what.Things happen. I get smacked in the face again. I had a couple of executives like take money from1,1,1,1 portfolio company. I had another executive almost crashed with my other company, and I had to go back and take the driver's seat, man.And sometimes that's what that's what happens in life, right, Tomo, why do you, you know, why did that happen, I wonder if you can kind of circle it all back to health and feeling properly good and feeling.Aware, yeah, not sick. exactly. You know, and I talk about this. I, it's funny. I'm, I'm writing a book right now, too.'s my first book. it's called Operation Op.And it's a book on how to basically build your most optimal life. Talk about hormones, talk about one else about mindset. But talk about how everything kind of stems from this physical body being good first., And I used to think the exact opposite, you think mental first, right, and then physical, But if your physical is just, can we swear on here, okay, if your physical shit. I want to be respectful to your audience, of course, But if your physical is shit, if it's not working. Okay, if you're just complete mess, you're fat, your hormones are a mess.You know your body's breaking down, you can't get your mentality right, It's not possible, So what do you need to fix first?Get regimented. Get that programming in your mind where you fix your physical form first, your mental follows. Your money follows that., it all just cascades. And what's the one thing that you would sacrifice.But what's the one thing that you would sacrifice everything else for your health, Yeah, because without your health, it's nothing. Yep, you work all this time, all this effort, all this energy, blood money, what a lot of people call it to sacrifice not only your health and your mental health. It's not worth it at the end of. But I understand it. I understand most people that are like, no, dude, I got to grind. I got a hustle. I got to go ahead and make it happen, right, And once you get there and you do have the money, I urge every single one of you guys spend the money to actually make yourself happy, happy and healthy..I'll almost take it one step further and say you can do both Yeah you can you can be healthy, physically well focused on making sure that you're maintaining your health and wellness while making a bunch of money and further from that, you will make more money because if you're healthy in this body, your brain works.

Your brain works better. You're going to think better. You're gonna make better decisions. You're gonna make more money. It's, it's all a big, it's all a big cycle. It goes, It goes like that. It's what what we like to call life by design, man, there you go, Life by design. not just successful financially but successful in all aspects of life, you know, health, mental health, core values, finances, faith, right, What would you say, when you go back and you rewind the time, dude, let's talk about your police career. I mean, half of my audience.First responders, dude or former or current. I mean, there's a lot of guys out there. I even got Sheriff Blanco coming from Riverside on this the show in a few weeks. fantastic. I know we're, we're gonna start getting political here. Listen, we're in a good climate right now for for politics. we're okay right now., trust with man. But yeah, so let's go back into your law enforcement career, man. how long were you in law enforcement,12 years just under.😊.What did you do inside of law enforcement, Did you do different units, were you a sergeant like did little so did some I was mostly, I was mostly patrol. I was never gonna get promoted. Why politics., also, I a problem with authority. Game of Thrones, man, Game of Thrrononees.Yeah.Problem with authority didn't like to didn't like to schmooze up to, you know the upper staff. You were a cop. cop cop. I like the street. I had a lot of fun. Love working on the ghettos And before I even get the story. I've spoken to hundreds of entrepreneurs. And one thing I consistently see them struggle with is their sales process.

Yeah, I mean, we were already pre programmegrammed in academy. I mean, when you have the police chief coming into an academy class and they tell you like hey guys check this out. I know you guys are brand new You guys are not even sworn but everybody's looking at you, nobody likes you So prepare yourself and you're like, okay, I just signed up for this career and you're telling me this like the note I'm hated it's just like all eyes on you, bro.So yeah, so you know most of my careers in patrol now I did some stints joint terrorism task force, I did some street crime stuff, it some DUI unit stuff, did some stuff that we can't talk about politely on camera so some other stuff with some three letter agencies that were always fun you know so I got a lot of tactical training I got a lot of interview interrogation I never waterboard anybody personally but you know I'm sure somebody around me has.うん。What what was it about the career at that time that made you a proactive cop because even talking to you right now in person finally after like three years guys, I could tell you were proactive I could just tell because at a time I was no so was truly at a time I was I love being proactive I love going after drugs and guns and gangs what happened towards the tail in my career yeah.Especially and this was. And I was, I was in Cleveland, Ohio at first, five years. and then I did about 7 in Clwater, Florida. Okay, so Clearwater, Florida, a little bit more politically leaning left, yep.And they basically took the wind out of a lot of cop sales because everything was racist. Yeah, everything was sexist, Everything was a problem. Don't do this. Don't do that. We're getting complaints. I'm like.Like, I thought we were here to bus criminals. right, What happened. And this is, this is why I ended up transitioning out of there. And, I mean, I wasn't.I didn't like to take direction that didn't make sense to me., I would have been horrible in military role. You wanted to believe in it. Why I wanted to, I want there, I want it to make sense. Yeah, don't harass people in this community. Whom I harassing. The black community is complaining.I'm like, the whole communitys black. Yeah, I don't understand. I'm like, who's complaining. Well, we're getting complaints that you're just coming up and harassing people. I'm like the crack dealers. Yeah, the gang members. I'm like, are they the ones complaining yeah.WellThis is madness. And I mean, it went so far to where they like pulled me out of the hood, put me on the beach. They put me in in the white neighborhoods. And I'm sorry to make it a race thing, but it is where it is. the high crime area was a high crime area. They were selling crack and her gang members. Yeah, That's where I like to work because I felt like I actually make a difference. pulling granny over and giving her a traffic stop and giving her a ticket for 12 over. I could probably count on both hands on many tickets I wrote in the last five years of my career. Yeah, it doesn't make sense. I don't do that. I'm going.I'm up for$30 ticket because they were speeding to work right Well I pull you over if you're driving like an asshole, Yeah, of course, butm, I wasn't that kind of cop, Yeah, you know, so from a proactive standpoint, I was much more proactive in Cleveland.Clear water I tried to be, and they took the wind out of my sails and ultimately pushed me out, You know, and I got all kinds of I A stuff at the end of my career. I don't know if I told you this. Well, that's usually what ends up happening, man. You know, the more proactive cops, right.

wantant to get and take off the drug dealers and the murders and all that stuff, Right you end up you end up getting internal investigations. So they end up drilling you. And this is why it's very hard for law enforcement officers now, even in 2025 because they're under a microscope. right, Just imagine, guys, You guys are a police officer. You're in that blue uniform, right, Like it or not, right, And you pull over somebody now, guess what. that person can make an allegation saying oh, they harass me all they touched me and youd't even do it. you can even be the friendliest cop out there.was was raised, since b b, guess what?Now you're going through internal investigation now they put you on probation now they suspend you and that affects your family that affects your livelihood that affects your mental state. So so why is crime risen throughout the years because of that exact action happening behind the police departments and the narrative that a lot of the media goes and paints the picture saying that the guys in blue are bad That's a complete bullshit anyways, this is the level up so let's be positive here Why leveled up since then., you know, and I hope that people on here, you know, not saying that people need to leave their law enforcement here because we need cops. Yes, we do. We need cops. We need good cops. You know, are you meant to be a cop, I hope a lot of you are yeah.You know, but like this is the level of podcast. And why are we on here, We're talking about leveling up. It could mean leveling up in law enforcement. Yeah, doesn't need to be, doesn't need to be leveling up and become entrepreneurs and become writing books and all these different things. that happened to us. But I will say one thing for anybody out there.And I know you agree with this because we haveve talked about this Yeah, of course, the amount that you learn being a cop.Conflict resolution, communication, documentation, writing, you know, multitasking, although I'm not a big person to multitasking anymore, I'm very dedicated on like, you know I've dedicated focus, but dealing with what we deal with in law enforcement prepares you to do so much more outside of law enforcement100%, I agree and every aspect that you just talked about man, I mean, if it wasn't for law enforcement, I wouldn't be able to lead, I wouldn't have the skills to do actually do public speaking the way I do.Man presence, I think it's huge, you know, a lot of people, especially in sales leadership, you know, correct me if I'm wrong, Tomo, but you know, you have probably hundreds or dozens of employees, right so?What do what do you say about culture, what what is your idea behind culture, what is your opinion behind culture, culture in the workspace in a company standpoint, yeah.Here's, here's how most companies screw up culture. They don't even have vision and values listed. They don't even know what their vision and values are. Yeah, they're just going in to make money, yeah.So when you come into a company, what's your vision, What's your values, Project that to everybody else in the company. right, You will do two things, one, you will find out that.There are people that truly believe in your vision and in the way that you have your values set up and the way that everything kind of flows in your life and you will also eat out people that don't absolutely which is almost more important.So the reason why I bring culture is because you're a cops cop dude. So you had that specific culture going into being proactive, going into law enforcement, going to certain departments that guess what. Now you're affiliate with a certain type of policing. Now you're affiliate with certain cops that respected you because of the work that you did the leadership that you brought into. So it was the same mindset as me. with me, man, I was already playing the political game and law enforcement. I was going in there. You know what.Yeah.I'm just gonna go ahead, do my job. But I'll be nice to everybody. And then, you know, I'm like, you know, political guy. I'm like, hey, dude, it's all good., That's a smart dude in law enforcement, what other choice do you have smart you had my choice. be patrol forever. You're absolutely right. That was my choice. you're absolutely right, man. But at the end of the day, there's so many ways to skin a cat. But yes, to agree with you, brother, law enforcement is what built me up to, I should be a great entrepreneur and to do.😊Decent in my life so with that being said when was it when you want to head like what year was it when you finally transitioned out of law enforcement 2018 So in 2018 you go to your mom and you're like mom I'm gonna go ahead and transition wasn't even that I'll give you the story Yeah 2018 I'm like I got to get the hell out of here had a bunch of IA complaints for bullshit I'll spare you guys details you're more than welcome to look it up.I'll give you the quick, give you, I'll give all of you the quick how many domestic violence calls you go on, hundreds, hundreds, hundreds on patrol, hundreds.Prostitute somebody else. It's not domestic violence. They got a verbal argument. It is not anything. So I don't write a full report. I write notes, document, make sure everything's okay. It''s basically bull your call.They find out I apply for the FBI Oh, they found out.The moment they found out, I got like 9 I A'as put against me and they referenced that case and said, I didn't follow policy, which they're right. technically, they're right, Ca it came out a domestic violence call. I'm supposed to write a domestic violence report. So they were right. But cops do that 10 and 50000 times a week.Yeah.We all know how to squash a call. Yeah, That's bullshit. Yeah, If you wrote a report for every call you went on, we would be nonstop writing novels all day. We wouldn't be able to do our jobs. I mean, I mean, it's true. It's true. That's what happened. So that's what happened. So I'm at this point. They end up not sustaining anything. They end up basically throwing everything out.And at that point I was talking to friends and I'm like I'm like I can't do this job no more, they screwed my FBI chances up, I was super pissed about that was blessing in disguise buddy of mine his names Kurt Henchll lives in Columbia now by the way doing some cool stuff down there.And he says, he says, bro, he's like, you're into the health and the wellness. the body buildings like, why dont you go work for your bodydy, Jeff and work through his medical clinics and see if you can do something there. So that friend gave you the idea. He said, get out of this job. Yeah,100%. And do you think if he wasn't there to essentially lead you to that path, Would you have taken that path to yourself, I don't think, I't I would have thought of it.I don't think I would have thought of a heai talk.

s like three in the morning. I remember the conversation in the hood, you know, wait for somebody shoot somebody exactly. So he tells me this so I go and approach my buddy, Jeff, and he has since died. So God rest his soul.😊嗯。Even though he and I didn't end friends, I still am grateful for him forever for allowing me and helping me to get a law enforcement. I went to him, and I said, you have anybody doing sales and marketing. He's like, no, bro, he's like, but I would love to have somebody. I said, I'm your guy. you're cop. I'm like, here's my social media. Here's all the stuff. And he's like, okay.So that's what brought me out of law enforcement and transitioned me to this medical space because I was a patient at the clinic. I was a patient at the clinic already get peptides, get an HR T. I'm in my early 30s,10 years of midnight shift. my testosteral levels tanked.It will do that. by the way, get your hormones tested, please for love of God. please, yeah, all law enforcement. We want you guys optimal. We want you guys healthy.So I go and do sales and marketing, I build this company from roughly a little bit under 800 patients to almost 409 months. I love that and I ended up having to transition out of there because of some.We'll just say legal issues that happened inside that business from a law enforcement side that I got tipped on. and I'm like, I need to get away from it. Yeah I was very strongly told to get away from it. So I had to make a decision, go back to police work or take everything that I had all my credit going to tremendous debt, stop paying my car payment, stop paying my mortgage I literally stopped paying everything and my credit score all the way down to the low 500s wow, and I put everything that I had into building as spiralrejuvenation clinic. So you took that risk and what year was that 2019.20 later so you got okay so so let's talk about the transition So the transition is you have a buddy you're about to go to the FBI you get screwed by the department departments like yo, you ain't leaving because it's Game of Thrones guys in law enforcement the way it is very political so they'll screw you over if they want to and then you do a pivot I could see you working for the FBI dude I really can it would have been probably I probably would have had a lot of fun Yeah but I still think that I would have maybe been a little.It unsatisfied, probably because there's always something in the back of my head that I said something more something different, something else.Gods God's the best of planners bro, and I think I mean, dude, we have very similar mindsets and if you're anything like me or maybe you're my brother from another mother, brother maybe but.With me every few years, I feel like I have to go ahead and start a new fire. And when I say a new fire, I'm talking about a new idea, a new concept, I have to get my hands dirty again. And what I found out about myself, an entrepreneurship, right, because that's the thing, guys, I will stay a student in the game. And always tell you this, stay a student of the game, no matter at what level you guys get, because with every new level, there's new double So what I found out about myself is I'm a startup guy. I am a visionary guy. I'm a startup guy like that. I am the guy.be like, all right you tell me an idea. I'm like, okay, bro, this is exactly how we can execute it. You roadm it. Yeah, I roadm it. and then I'll get you started. We'll start generating revenue. cool, let's find people smarter than us to operate the shit delegation. who how who not how That's it. That's it. And And that's what I've been doing for the past couple years now, But what your situation, man, that that's almost like very similar path that I took, man, because.😊I had started a side hustle with ATMs at that time, dude, I was making residual income, and that's cool.But what was the game changer was that one friend that So you had one friend that tell you, like, hey, dude, don't be stupid. Get out of this get. I have that one friend, dude, I had made, I had just started digital marketing and.Yeah.April of 2020 during that time. So by January, no, I'm sorry, by March of 2021, I hit my first six figures just in the online space. Why you're still law enforcement. I was still law enforcement. Here's, here's the crazy part. A lot of people don't know this. So when I find in the online space in 2021.I didn't tell anyone I was in law enforcement Sure at all because I was just like, dude, the department would eat me a lot. Oh yeah, right in California right Yeah, oh dude, you know, yeah, yeah, you know, I'm not in California for for many reasons guys, but you know what it is so.I didn't tell people until I actually exited, which was right before4 of July in 2021.And I had that one friend tell me the month prior to like dude to get the fuck out of here. literally your independence came right before independence Day it literally Yeah, yeah, I literally shipped out everything, sold my house and and I told myself dude I want to be out of the comfort zone.Yeah.So I went to San Diego, I went to San Diego, got a nice little penthouse in front of the ocean dude. What is a Coronado Island, So I used to see the NavyCs getting like dumped into the water at5,6 a every morning dude Yeah, I was just like, god damnamn, this is like some crazy shit.But it transitioned and it actually changed my life to you, you know why, because the people around me.So sometimes it takes you guys being around the right environment and listening to positivity guys, actually leveling up your guys' mindset, what you guys listen to, what you guys watch who you around because it's that saying analysis sounds cliche but the most cliche thingss are always right where if you spend, let's say, most of your time with five people that are not doing shit in life, guess what, you won't become shit Now you're hanging around with multimillaires, billionaires, political figures, people that are leveling up.They're at a different level in life and you're like, dude, I'm trying to get there, right just so just so I can say I can because now it's purpose.And you know what, it's, it's like, it's through like almost like attrition. It's through like osmosis. like you', you gain momentum almost through osmosis. If you guys, if you guys know what osmosis is basically like you're absorbing,, you're absorbing all these things around you.I, I started leveling up more and more. probably. I would I mean, Gary behind the camera where Gary's my videographer guy. And he saw it. He like he and I, he and I almost like shared some tears because we're both looking at each other and we're like, do you believe this is happened last time we were in Dai or second or last time we were in Dubai and we're just like, do you believe that like you just became friends with the third richest man in Dubai. Like he's like, he's wanting to be around you all the time. He's inviting you to dinners. He hosted my.

In his palace. That's bad asper., and, and fed us with lamb from his farm. It's a very big honor to get food from his personal farm It huge. So you know, we're in, we're in his palace. And, you know, looking at that.That circle came from another circle. That circle came from another circle and all of its risk. my life is full of risk. I'm not very risk averse, but you got used to it. I enjoy it.Like I, I literally, I'd said this on a podcast. not too long ago. And somebody asked me like, what, what would you feel and what would you do if you went to 0 right now, Like everything was gone.I was like, I, I literally and excuse me my French. Everybody. I was like, everybody's fucked. Yeah, I said everybody's fucked, I'd be so excited. I said, if God gave me that opportunity to put me back to 0 and made me hungry like that again,, I said, you're, you can't stop me. You know, You thought I did well now, I love.I no, I love that because I think about this all the time. Yeah, you know, people always ask me like, hey, so.You know, you're doing all this stuff, right, And it costs money and, and you're traveling and you're taking all these risks. But what if you lose it all, And I'm like.I'll just build it again It's just it's not one of those things like probably build it better here's my thing, Tommo it's not one of those things like I, I actually eliminated a couple words from my vocabulary.When people go ahead and ask me, can you do this, will you do this, or do you think you can do this, I go ahead and say, I don't think I do it. I don't, I don't say babiess. I don't say an's, I' say, but I'll give excuses. It is the same thing when I married my wife last year, dude, When I came, I was like right before a wedding day, dude. We went to go have dinner.And I sat her down, I was like, hey, babe, so you know, before we get married, I just want to have a very serious conversation with you and this conversation don't get offended.I you like where this is going you law enforcement as long as you say with all due respect, fuck yourself exactly but you're saying it respectful. may have said that to a couple ser. You know, and I've taught Emilio well, I' told Emilio, you know, because he manages a couple people right He's a head guy here. He's our engineer So, so I told me itll do as long as you just tell him with all due respect. let him have it. He's like, really, I was like, yes, not really, but yeah,.But anyway, I have this conversation with my wife. And that's all I was like, hey, babe. So, you know, you're my one. you're my best friend. And this is why I'm making the decision, the conscious decision to go ahead and marry you. And I was just like, look.😊There's one thing I want you to promise me. I want you with everything that we do in life together to have the most confident and be so decisive.That no one will ever doubt you. And I think, with most people.The reason why they will never go ahead and build authority. The reason why they will never go ahead and build great things, dude, is because they're not sure of themselves. Yes, they're not sure of themselves. Yes, You know how many people I meet on a daily basis, dude, where I'm like, hey, so you want to come work with us, right, get dams all the time. We get emails all the time, dude, Hey, can I come work for you, dude, I'm the best. Okay, cool, let's get on phone call.Would you be able to generate this much revenue one month, They're like, maybe this is like, let me stop you right there, dude, Yeah, you really lost your chances, yeah.Because at this stage of the game, dude, I need people that are hitters, just like in law enforcement. Sure, dude you want to go with somebody who's freaking a badass already has that level of confidence, that energy. We want to know that they can take our business. Yes, you know, confidencefience is huge, man. confidencefi is huge. And I know that because I've been in a place where I've lacked it, yeah.And even like, I'm not talking about, like, even when I was.Super jacked bodybuilder. I mean, you, you could find pictures on my social media or on even on Google. I think my Google panel has a bunch of old bodybuil pictures. I don't know why that has that. I'm like, I've been bodybuild since 2018, so.You know, even at that time when I looked like a Greek statue, I still was lacking confidence for one reason or another.It's when I started having the real conversations in the mirror and started looking at myself. And I'm like, okay, and here, here's my mirror. Yeah, I started looking at I'm like, okay, what do I see, Who am I, What do I want? What do I want is something nobody asks, Have you noticed that.Yeah.How many people that are even watching this, What do I want, Oh, I want to be rich. Shut up. How rich, How much money, What's your wife look like, What kind of cars do you drive, What not just what kind of car I want to drive a Mer. I want to drive a Lamborghini. No, what color is it.What model is it, What year did you like the classics, you like the new ones, Which one do you want, I want one of each. There you go. We're getting somewhere. When I started having these conversations started writing down and saying, this is how I want to curate my life.Here is my superhero version of myself. When I started doing that, I started believing it. I got the confidence, and I started doing it.I mean, I think you were, then I, wasn't I with you the same day when I got to Lamborghini, I didn't even care about actually getting in Lamborghini. I cared about the fact that I could afford it. It's the principle. I was like.Oh, I could afford it What Lamborghini. They' like, yeah, you're good., here's your lamborgni. I'm like,, you didn't get the fulfillment out of it. You got you what it was. iss just the fact that you can do it. That's it. Yeah, right. But the point is that when I started having these conversations look in the mirror, like really looking into my soul.Yeah.Who am I, What, What is the better version of myself look like, Well, the better version of myself is healthy, They are wealthy. They are well they are well liked. They are appreciated. They are grateful. Grtitude is huge, right? They walk with honor and conviction, Do well respected, man. Oh, you, if you look at yourself like that. And you can visualize what that version of you is.The rest is easy. Yeah, the rest is just work. Yeah, works the easiest part, yeah.And it just takes level of discipline. and for most people, they just won't go ahead and have that level of discipline to get to that better version of themselves. People always say like, hey, what, why don't you stop?

。You already got enough. You're greedy. I'm like, dude, it's not about the greed. It's about chasing the better version of yourself. This why you have high performers like Tmo. You know, dude, you really, I got enough money, dude,, you really take care everybody. I I'm pretty sure you take care of your mom. You get it whatever she wants, right, Shes just bought her new Mercedes last she wants won't let me buy our house yet. I'm just gonna end up having to do it. Yeah,, I mean, that's just what it is. right have a house. I'm like whatever. So,, so with that being said. now it's more., just principal purpose.And just become the greater version of yourself And that's what I tell people man like you know me now on my health journey right is's just like what I told myself is like, wow, I found that my wife was pregnant I was just like, oh my God this is like unexpected dude because we weren't gonna start trying into August But now that the babys gonna be born into some Tri bro.Well, obviously it work bro. I did something right. Yeah,, but now that we're expecting the baby in December, I'm like, you know, I'm telling Mike because Mike is our mutual friend guys and he's optimizing me right now.😊Until Mike I was just like, he's like, hey, dude, so you' you're pretty good size, you know youre getting your shrink is there, he's just like, where are you trying to take this, He's like are you trying to take this to the next level and I'm like to be honest, dude, yes, here's the reason why.Just because when my son is born, I want him to look to me and be like, dude, my dad is freaking jacked and it's just a principal it's just the principal guys, this is not not for me, it's more for my family. You're his superhero anyway already, Yeah, but you want to really be looking like a superhero Yeah, dude why not's of course Amen, when you think about it, if you were five years old,10 years old and in your father pulled up and let's say a Ferrara, Lamborghini, you know, all the freaking toy cars, but in real life.Your dad was jacked. dude, what level of confidence are you gonna instill in your son. Yeah, Of course, What type of standards are you gonna instilling to your children, better, better, better question, What type of standards, Yeah, right, Yeah, because like the material stuff is cool. It's like, it's like a little bit of flexing. Yeah, for your kid, too. Yeah, you know, my dad has a fro carry up. absolutelys getting picked up at school. It's cool. Yeah, but if your dad's in shape and your dad's healthy, He looks younger than the rest of the dad's.😊Yeah.B we hold you. I'm 37,37. So we're almost same age. I'm a couple years older. Neither of us look 40 or almost 40. Yeah, and you look at 40 year olds out there, where they're fat. They're, theyre, they're balding. They have bad skin. They have all kinds of health problems. cholesterol blood pressure, blah, bla, blah. Their hormones are shit. They have no sex drive.Okay, well, that's what a normal 40 year old must look like yeah.We both still have so much to improve, but we're already way above. We're already in the 1% of that, right,1% of wealth is easy. The only that's actually more rare right now for a man to be able to bench. I think it's either 2,25 or 1,35 pathetic. I saw that. Yeah, and also, then then it is to be 10 million or more in in net worth. really.Yeah.Also, to have a six pack, to have abs, to have a six pack of abs, it is so monumentally rare that there are more people that are deca millionaires in the world. Wow, that's insane. What does that tell you, Thats And, and here's a cool thing, Like, you can earn money. Any can earn money. Anybody on the planet can earn enough money to be a millionaire, yeah..But you can't buy your way to health and, and wellness and longevity. Yeah, you get more surgeries. You got to work. You got to eat right, You got to go to the gym. You got to do all these things. Absolutely, so if you're able to do that, plus hit your status of becoming a millionaire or multimillionaire. Gu, You are the 1% of the 1%. And that's just the way it goes, right, That's it. So Tomo.Yeah.Now we talked about now your journey from law enforcement break into this space in your health journey let's talk about bodybuilding all right because come on we have a lot of people that watch the show by the way guys, thank you today what is today August 29th guys So August 29th we officially hit number four in all categories I don't know if you saw that All right but yes we did so it's pretty cool's awesome it's it's pretty cool because we.I guess you could say our dream for the past year we were just like dude, if we could just surpass Rogan one time that'd be the flex, you know just the principal just to say But now we're like bo all right cool up right now it So it's good clap back clap back Joe Rogan get us on the show bro show there you go but with that being said man So let's talk about bodybuding When did you start bodybuild I know you were doing this while you were still in law enforcement but tell us a little bit of background on that.13 years old, I come back from Croatia and Bosnia, this is right after the war, and I came back and had a massive growth spurt when I was over there.Food water, Who knows, I don't know, But I grew like 7 inches plus in three months, Wow, so.If anybody's ever had a gross spur when they're younger,7 inches and three months is drastic. And, I mean, I have stretch marks going sideways on my lower back and on my knees. Wow, that's how fast I grew. So I was like the shortest person in my friend group. I came back to tallest for my friend group after a summer.😊Tremendous pain broke, my knees, my back, everything hurts. So I go to my mom thanks me to a doctor because I literally couldn't I couldn't sleep, bro, I couldn't do anything.And the doctor says there's nothing I can do about these growth pains. He said, but I'm going to prescribe that you go to the gym and strengthen the muscles around your joints.Revolutionary at this time. you know what I'm saying, prescribing me to go to the gym. Go it Doctor did this now, we wouldn't have so many problems with how fat the population is and diabetes and heart disease and all these issues. It like that doctor actually cared actually carried. Yeah, exactly. So he tells me to go to the gym,13 years old. He got my first gym membership. I get taken under the wing by a man named Don Dovito got Ru's soul and he starts teaching me the ways of bodybuild and the ways of fitness and, and how to, how to do certain things. I mean, this guy was revolutionary. Like, you remember like.😊I mean, you know, like Han Robbad and stuff like that FST 7, yep, I was doing that shit when I was 13 Wow this this so you were ahead of the game I started working out and started bodybuilding a long time before a lot of the bodybuding stuff started to come out like a.

。The training tech. Are doing that. Yeah, I was, I was forced feeding myself so much chicken and beef. And thankfully, my mom and my family had a restaurant. So I was able to afford all that routine. Well your parents, you know, encouraging you. They were like, yes, Tom will keep going. My mom was. My father was already living back in Europe. they divorce when I was young. He wasn't a big fan of the bodybuilding stuff.ow, Yeah, he wasn't a big fan. wasn't a big supporter of it. obviously, you know, he was wrong. I think bodybuilding is a lot of the reason why I'm so disciplined and able to take so much.Pain is getting through bodybuild and working out and getting, getting into this wellness routine, this fitness routine. It builds some character, man. It does like discipline for sure, force feed yourself to grow, to starve yourself to lean out to go into the gym over and over again for months and months at a time while stuff sore while things hurt and you're still doing it all to get on stage for.65 seconds, Max, if you do well, that's what you did. Let me ask you, Yeah, please, why do you think bodybuders do it?Do you think it's because they come from a point of pain that they're trying to go ahead and like present themselves as like, look, I could go ahead and do this, something that most people are not able to do which I think I think you' so I'm assuming the demo of the podcast is mostly man yeah.。Men and women is a men and women is about half and half okay, so great. Okay, so I can only speak from a man's perspective. I can't speak from a man's perspective. So I can only give you from the man's perspective. Men need to go through pain. Men have to do things that are hard. You have to go through hard shit to be a real man. I'm gonna say that right away. Yeah, All of bodybuild, all of fitness, all of wellness. Now, men can get too far removed from what it actually means, and you can start getting into a start getting into a place where.It's more vanity and it's more negative. And you can kind of get like this body dysmorphia thing where, you know, and I've had that. anybody's bodybuiling has body dysmorphia. Yeah anybodying, but at least like, y, yeah, I hated how I looked when I was in the best shape of my life. now I look back at these pictures in 2018, I'm like, what was I thinking, What was I complaining about Yeah looked like a statue bro was crazy, You know, but why do people gravitate towards bodybuilding, I think because it's hard. Yeah, now, women, it could be for a different reason.I can't speak for you and you know maybe they can drop some comments in here and say, hey, this is why I did it. it could be for beauty, it could be for just you know being physically fit because I think all people should be physically fit. Now the problem with bodybuilding is what it takes to get to the next levels So the amount of drugs that need to be used in professional bodybuilding and competitive bodybuild, certain types of drugs that women use that are detrimental to women, sorry, not sorry is what it is I can speak to this because I've been in it I was in.For for almost 20 years I was I'm friends with most of the top level IFBB I have trained with these guys I mean, the adons of bodybuilding Cbuum, I can pull you a picture from like 2016 of me and him training in Columbus together before Cbuum was Cbuum that's how old I am in the industry did you think Cum was gonna be great Yes, when I first trained with him truly like this kid special physical specimenman bro Cbuum is a physical.imThere is no amount of drugs that I could take no amount of drugs that most people could take to B bum I'm going to say that completely confident now the guy works Sa off to he had to work hard he had to eat perfectly same thing can be said about Arnold Schwarzenegger.You can't be on Schwarzenegger. Nobody can grow his chests. unbelievables biceps, unbelievable. Yeah, doesn't matter how much drugs you take. Ronnie Coleman, same thing. Yeah, buddy.Ronnie Coleman sacrifice lot Also ask cop. Yeah, yeah, right that. Yeah that. So Ronnie Coleman, you know, you can't be Ronnie Coleman, the guy was a massive just spectacle of human performance and engineering. That's God made. And he looked like that before he ever took steroids. He looked like a monster of four steroids. Yeah You can pull pictures of him. Yeah, right, But why bodybuil, bodybuil build discipline.😊Yeah.You have to force feed yourself to grow. You have to starve yourself to die down. You have to go to the gym. You have to have such a level of consistency planning. And if you're going into the professional route, pharmaceuticalhars alone, man, you screw up one of these pharmaceuticals. your whole career is going down the tube for that year. It's real. It's real. So I mean, half these bodybuilders know more about the endocrine system and and physical chemistry, then doctors do. It'ss real. You're absolutely right. Yeah, so you know.My bodybuild taught me a lot about.How to be more disciplined, how to go through the pain, how to really and like, I was, I look at it now., and law enforcement is painful mentally, too. it is right, the the pressure of the anxiety that we get, you know, all that shit prepared me for where I am now. Now I look at it. I'm like, oh, this business deal's not going through and it's fucking joking me. No, that's not more stressful the time I almost got shot in the face. It's not more stressful than the time I was starving. death to get on stage for 30 seconds. That was stress. This is easy.Yeah.I feel like the way that entrepreneurs and people in general frame their ideas of what stress is, Yeah, because a lot of people, you know, I'll give you guys a great example last in 2024, when you know, I had somebody take 200 K from one of my bank accountss, or employee that was well off Why collar her guy drove McLalarren Gwa And then he decided, oh yeah, for the funds of it, I'm gonna take 200 K from a former detective, you wanted anotherlarren, maybe I don't know. exactlyact right?Okay.But people were like, dude, what do you do, I would have been so stressed out on my mind. I would have lost it. I would have killed the guy. Gu, I'm quote Kong collected. There's something that I would say, F him on paper. Yeah, fuck on paper. Yeah, That's all I did. I was just like, you know what, make a phone call. Give my lawyer, boom, a, dude, it's a freaking felony crime where you're based out of your' fucked.Yeah.Giveing back the money. gave back the money. wired it. gave an opportunity. Oh yeah, nice. Come on, dude, the police resistance. I mean, you to know this path least. But most people in business don't do that. I know. I know they go sc earth on shit. I know, dude, I know it it might have been the you know, the meds I was on during that time. And I was me out. It choke me out, but.😊

Nowadays, you know, I'm a little bit more aggressiveca I'm back to me, but good with that I'm happy to hear that, I'll be hear theions back.But with the framing of things, I like how you frame it because you're like, dude, I've been through the hardship. I've been through law enforcement. I've been through the bodybud. I've been through the worst of the worst. And now business dude is just a business deal. Most people overcomplicate life. And I think, for you specifically, Tommo, you've been through it all, dude, But here's the thing. You also have, you live multiple different lives. And that's why I tell people, you know, I've lived three different lives. You know, corporate America, law enforcement and full time entrepreneur, Same thing with you, dude. You've been in so many different aspects. So what would you tell.Okay.A beginner entrepreneur, Okay, if you were to go ahead and speak to younger Tomo Tomo that's 21,22. He's looking at this interview right now. He's like, dude, I want to be like that guy. I want to be in Dubai. I want to I want to be friends with the third richest guy in Dubai. eat lamb as well at his palace. Good lamb, Great lamb.What would be three needle movers that you would tell these young entrepreneurs right now to focus on, especially in their 20s, I mean, if you're in there if you're at that age?Number one, don't be risk averse. Okay, don't be afraid to risk. Don't be afraid to fall in your face, especially at that age. I did it in my early to mid30s. and I did it to a point where I'm like, I didn't have a nest egg. I didn', I could have felt back on a family if I really needed to. But when you're doing your 30s, little more risky. Yeah, you're kind of already established. You have like bills and shit. You, a credit score. Yeah know what I mean, I didn't care about any of that. So I was very risky. if you're in your early 20s.And you can fall on your face so hard and you can literally, I mean, you can fuck up so bad and you still so much time, risk aversion is a negative, it's a net negative.Go towards things that are risky. Obviously, don't be stupid. I want to fly. Ju off a cliff. You're an idiot. Sorry, don't be risk averse when, like, like I took riskly, I bought a car. I bought a Porsche when I shouldn't have bought a Porsche, but I bought a Porsche strategically to get into a circle of people that all were driving Fers and Lamborghinis, which LED me to a private members club, where I'm rubbing shoulders with millionaires, billionaires and senators and house representatives members.Yeah.That was risk. paid off. I then became a member of that private club that I couldn't afford risk, paid off. Why, Because I'm seeing that my risk is purposeful. So number one, don't be risk averse, number 2.Yeah.Build your network like it's the only thing that matters. Network is key dude. It's the, it's almost the only thing that matters. It is who, you know means so much more than what you know, And it means so much more than what you can access in any way, shape or form, because your friends, your friends and the people that like you.Yeah.Are the number one, the number one needle mover., Why do I get connected with multi billionaires in Dubai, Because I have trusted friends that are also in that network and networks start to spread, right, They, by the way, they don't spread wider. They get smaller.You know, the guy, the multi billionionaire in Dubai, his network is this big. my network is maybe this big. Yeah a lot of your guys network is this big, Why because you're hanging around dip shits, you're hanging around people that don't actually.Do anything positive for your life or for themselves. And you you are the five people you hang out with. You I said it early in the podcast. You are the five people that you spend the most time with, facts.So constantly audit your circle and make sure you're networking with intention and not to get something out of it. Super important. I love that. Don't network to get something out of it. Network to become friends and learn and offer value to people. Yes, that's my number two piece of advice.Number three, it's going to sound like cliche and simple.Take care of your physical and mental health. Yeah, it's, it's,, you're screwed without it. You're screwed. And I'm not just saw about mental health like, you know, oh, the depression, the anxiety stuff. I'm talking about like, read books, read books, learn.This body, okay, this body what you and what you have, this is you're at war as a man, as a man, I can only speak as men again, ladies, no offense to you.I know you're at War I in different ways, but as a man, I leave my home every day and I'm at war from the moment that I leave that home to the moment that I go back to bed, which is also a reason why my piece is so preserved at my house.If, if my home is not peaceful, my home is not peaceful, then I don't have a peaceful life anywhere else. So you use this body. This is your, this is your army. This is your, this is your temple. Okay, but this is what's going to fight your battles. Your mind, sharpen this mind. This is the sword. This is your sword. You got to sharpen the sword all the time. read these books, Listen to these podcasts. Talk to people, learn things. It doesn't necessarily even need to be about your industry. Do you want to know what TV. I watch it. It's all documentaries.I love watching documentaries why, and I love watching historical documentaries specifically why I learn from history.And we have forgotten so much about history that we, we kind of don't realize we're making the same mistakes over and over again., go read about history. go learn stuff, constantlytant be sharpening that sword and making sure that your army, this body is ready for it. Those are my 3 bits of advice. that will literally elevate you, and you can become ontop. I truly believe that if you actually put the max effort into those three things.And you actually try. And let's, let's be clear. none of you put in 100%. I maybe got close a couple times. You maybe got close a couple times. You guys think, oh, I'm probably putting in 50% effort. It's probably 5.Factax, find me a day, you don't watch TV, find me a day, you don't surf social media, Find me a day. you never pick up your phone without needing it. Find me a day that you are a perfect level optimal operating person.That's 100%, it's impossible.

One of my friends, Andrew Tate, one of my brothers in the war room. Okay, I am a member of the war. I have no problem saying that out loud, Andrew Tate.Is an absolute machine. This is how this guy operates. I'd say that's the person that I've ever seen or heard of operating at close to 100% level. This guy does not stop, but I wouldn't want to live like that.But if you can operate at a 20 to 50% level, you're outpacing the entire market you're doing so well that you don't even realize One thing I have to give you your flowers on Tommo is the fact that you did bring up the war room you brought up and your and you're like do that dude it's on 100% of the time. I think one big thing that's going on one trend that's going on right now I don't know if you saw Alex Her Mosie's launch his10 million dollar book launch and you got half digital marketers in the online world promoting this right now but you guys got to understand that.Thanks, right, I that theres certain people that want to live that lifestyle that choose to live that lifestyle.
