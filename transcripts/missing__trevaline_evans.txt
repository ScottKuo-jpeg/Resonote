。Hi, crime junkies. I'm your host, Ashley Flowers. And I'm Britt. and you guys buckled theuff up because I'm about to take you for a ride today. Bt, you know this, My famous last words are like, oh, you know, this case seems interesting. It could make like a quick mini episode because no one else has done anything super media quick. Yeah, yeah, there just might not be a lot there. Well, wrong again. this case out of North Wales is one that police have called the strangest case they've ever worked. A woman.😊name travelling Evans vanished into thin air in the middle of a busy town 35 years ago after being seen with a mystery man. And in 2019, two guys in North Wales got a tip about where her body might be. and for the first time ever, we're going to report on their full story. and we have the never before published photos that they say prove they found her.Within 20 seconds, we're looking at a dead body right in front of us in's actually the place where the bad spell was coming from. There she is. I can see a face.There in apne with what appeared to be a hole in the sides of the skull, I could see the hair and photos that show someone might still be trying to cover up a murder.He invited us back and asked us to have another look again with our camera. My blood rang cold. We were both in so, dumbfounded shock to realization that the body that we'd seen in that floor had been removed.Yeah.🎼 It's just before midnight on Saturday, June 16,1990, when the North Wales police get a call from a man named Richard Evans, he's worried about his 52 year old wife travellingreline because she didn't show up to their dinner date that evening, Shes still not home. and he tells police that he'd already checked the little secondhand antique shop that she runs just a few blocks away in case she was burning the midnight oil. I mean, it was tourist season After all. But even though her car was parked near by, she didn't seem to be there and.Hanging on the door was a handwritten sign that sent chills running through him back in two minutes, it read.🎼Now, signs like this weren't uncommon to see on the door. Like it was something travelling often did. She would tape them up when she was just like stepping out really quick. But Richard had gone by the shop earlier in the day, and that same sign was hanging there back in two minutes. And the last time he went by late in the evening, He let himself inside through an unlocked back door and found more evidence that worried him. Her hand back, her keys jacket. They were all there inside her shop. Things she'd normally take with her. If she was going to go anywhere for more than.Two minutes. I mean, even her makeup compact was sitting out in the open on the counter like she had just been there. I mean, every single sign seemed to point to her coming back. So that's when he phoned police.🎼When officers responded to Richard's call, it seemed like they were thinking this might end like so many missing persons cases with the person just showing back up eventually, but there's only one way to know for sure. So they start by trying to piece together Treveline's movements that day, except her husband actually can't help with that. He tells them that he and Treveline had spent the earlier part of the week about an hour away in town called Rudlin, where they were renovating this little bungalow that they planned to live in once they were.Tired soon.Traveveline headed back to their current place in Lnggoughlin midweek to tend to her shop while Richard stayed behind to keep working on the place Now that dinner that she missed was the first time they planned on seeing each other once like both of them had gotten back and are we sure she ever actually made it back into town I mean I know her stuff's there but did anyone lay eyes on her Yes, so which is why I think maybe for a hot second they're like, oh, she's gonna be back I mean her husband even makes a plea early on through the media directly to his wife for her to come home?He says he doesn't understand why she would leave, they were happy, but he doesn't seem to know what else to think I mean, maybe he's afraid of the worst their police officer son who works a few towns over also named Richard I mean he's looking at the situation differently right from the start Like if she's gone in his mind someone forced her to leave and he tells reporters that his mom would never leave town without telling someone she had a business to run an aging dad to care for a grandchd.🎼A ton of friends. She wasn't in any financial trouble. She wasn't having any medical problems. I mean, truly, she seemed to be looking forward to retirement. He says there is no reason she would have to leave.And what's so confounding about this case is whether she left willingly or she was abducted, neither makes complete sense to me with what they end up learning through their investigation.Physical searches for traveling turn up nothing and these searches were extensive.

Become one of the most extensive searches in northern Welsh history for the time. And by the end, they searched a 12 mi radius around the town. They even drag the river. They search a local canal. I mean, they're looking inside caves and mine., they knock on every single door in town taking statements from hundreds of people and running down license plates on more than 650 vehicles. They also find traveling's address book. And according to the Daily post Who's reportingly relied on a lot for this episode, they call.🎼Every number listed. And remember, it is tourist season in this picturesque little town. So there could be a witness out there who's already come and gone and didn't even know that they saw something important, right? So police thinking this, also go and collect records from every hotel and bed and breakfast in the area and they contact more than 500 people on those lists, too. And while they never find anything physical in their searches for traveling. They do over time, collect a bunch of.😊Little puzzle pieces that when put together paint a picture of her last movements. But exactly when she put that be back in two minutes sign up, where she went after and who she met becomes an even bigger question because a few people did see travelling the day she vanished. And they say she wasn't alone.So let me start with the timeline from the first full day that Treline was back in town, this is Thursday.At about 9,15 in the morning, a local woman says that she sees travellingline unloading her car near her shop on church Street while speaking to two men. There is a grayhaired man in a suit. someone maybe in his like 50s with a briefcase. Everyone calls this guy these smartly dressed man very proper Yes but the witness also said that there was a young man across the street who was like locking a gate at another shop. and Travelline seemed to be speaking to him too. That's really all we know from Thursday. So then fast forward to.riThis is the day before she goes missing, there are more sightings of her and possibly more sightings of these two men.According to a crime watch special on the case, a couple of local shop workers see Treveline in the morning walking down the street with this same smartly dressed man in a navy blue suit with a black briefcase having a conversation Everything seems fine treline's even like waving to people that she knows.At 930, the Daily Post has somebody putting her by this like tannery shop near her store with the same smartly dressed older man.Then at 1230 she and this same guy are seen together in town on Oak Street and Oak Street is like a fourmin walk from her antique shop then we have them together again at 4 pm on Market Street which is right there in town too like Oak Street where they were earlier just like turns into Market Street when you cross Castle Street and actually Castle Street is the next sighting of her So at about 830 that evening, two locals were driving home down Castle Street and when they stopped at a light.They saw Treveline standing on the stoop of this shop and they said she was like holding some papers and was like poking her head out, she kept like popping in and out of this little stoop seems like she was waiting for someone to come walking down the sidewalk but they didn't see anyone even when they looked behind them and the woman in the car said that treveline normally would wave to them or something but she never even seemed to see them and so she didn't acknowledge them she seemed to just s or preoccupied in waiting for whatever or whoever,It was she kept looking for.Now that same evening, some tourists who were in town just for the weekend tell police that they see traveling with the same smartly dressed man at a place called Gail's wine bar, which is just one street over from where they were seen together earlier in the day and it's just around the corner from where that couple just saw her like popping in and out of this stoop I mean it's like a two to three minute walk to Gaes from there Okay so like all really in this like small local area close now all the sightings prior to the wine bar seemed to come from locals.I think police take those a tad more seriously and they actually only get this wine bar sighting after that crime watch episode airs like weeks out from when she went missing so I'm not saying they don't believe it, I just don't know how much they were able to follow up on it and what people would remember even if they did all those weeks later but you know like I was thinking to me it sounds like Treveline was waiting for someone to pick her up in a car Like if you look at this on a map this corner is at this big,Intersection where you would stop and the side that she is on I mean, I guess either side you could pop in but to me the way she's like in and out in and out it's like you can't miss the car right because like if the light turns green or something or even if it was a green light you like two seconds to pop in there's something about it to me that's like okay, was she waiting for someone to pick her up less like meeting somebody on the sidewalk Was it the smartly dressed man who picked her up I mean, if the sing at the wine bar is accurate, I would think it had to be right?Also it seems most likely since we know she's spending so much time with this guy for like so much of Friday Yeah I was gonna to say he's in all of these sightings, but he's just known as the smartly dressed man like none of the witnesses No not even the locals and this is still when her husband is out of town right Right So this brings me to Saturday June 16 again, 1990?

Sometime that morning, a woman who owned a local market told police that Tveline came in to buy some milk and something small she noticed is that when treveline opened her little purse. and when I say purse think more like tiny wallet than full bag. the shop owner said that she saw a stack of cash. Now, Richard and police found her actual like big purse handbag in her shop. and some reports say that money she'd had earlier in the day has never been found. But like don't spiral just yet, though. there might be an innocent..Now it seems Treveline made it to her store, opened up the shop like normal because that morning more than two dozen customers come in and out of the antique shop, even a friend stops by to bring tline some fresh flowers sometime before noon. and this friend says like everything seemed totally normal, they chatted a little bit, they had coffee, they even made plans to have a girl's night the next week.And it is after that friend leaves when the mystery really begins.A couple tells investigators that they were in Treveline's shop shortly after her friend left, and they saw Treveline like huddled in conversation at the back of her store with a man who matches our smartly dressed mysteryy man description. I don't know what they were talking about or if the couple could even hear anything. but they don't report anything else wild. They say they leave the shop. And then the next thing we know for sure is that sometime between 12 and one. Treveline's brother stop by the.and found the door locked and that be back in two minutes sign on the door, the one that Richard would discover later that night.Now one article I found mentioned that this brother made two stops at the shop like some 20 minutes apart and the sign was up both times and that wasn't a red flag to him No so like traveling had this slogan for her story it's like I'll buy anything and she really meant it so it wasn't weird for her to head out in the middle of the day multiple times a day to go meet someone for a sale or toto items that she could buy Rsell whatever or even just to leave for lunch from what I can tell it seems like she was the sole owner operator so there's like nobody.So totally possible that he could have missed her twice and I say this because right about the same time as the second visit, So this would have been out 1240 we get a really firm sighting of treline a passer by sees her locking up her shop key in hand I mean if she had anything else on her like a purse, whatever wasn't big enough for anyone to notice.And they say she's heading in the direction of the town center, like where all of those sightings were the day before, and then someone in town says that right about that same time is when she stops by the local market and she buys an apple and a banana.う。Now there is about a two hour window where no one reports anything, sightings or interactions in her store or out, And then at 230 pm, this woman who is familiar with Treveline says that she spotted Treveline near her own house, like Trevolline's house, which same as everything else like we're still within walking distance. mean if you're looking at a map basically you have like her shop on the right, you have the town center in the middle and then her house is just a little to the left of town center.う。Now she doesn't see her go in or out of her house she's just walking right near it heading back in the direction of town in the direction of her shop alone Yeah, she's alone at this time so do we think she's just like in and out of her shop a ton that day or is this back in two minutes just like her BB sign like I'll be back at some point two minutes doesn't really like discourage customers like it seems like a short amount of time So this is what's so interesting to me well two things actually so first she had other.Signs that she would put up if she was gonna be gone for longer like be back in a half hour back in two hours like the two minutes is like specific for the situation Yeah so if she went back, she could have like quickly hung another sign to say that she was going be out longer but she didn't and it's not like something happened to her in two minutes after she left because we know she's like fine and well at 230 So she didn't come back Well, this breaks to my second thing interestingly, the police find something.that maybe indicate she had made it back to the shop at some point after her 1240 trip into town to buy fruit There is a banana peel in the store's trash can like a fresh banana peel Well it's not fresh by the time they're seeing it Like she's not even reported missing until like 10 hours after she purchased it the shop is searched after that So was it the same banana peel Can't tell you I mean, people spent a lot of time pointing to this as a.that she made it back to the shop, but I'm like then where's the apple Like nobody talks about the apple not even mentioned. So I'm assuming it was never found, but I don't know And like did they find the banana peel in her store but the Apple or Apple core was in her house like there's never been any reporting about them searchingging traveling's house or what they found if they did and kind of like without the Apple the banana doesn't mean anything not to me Yeah So all that to say a lot of people think she came back because of the banana, but like I think that might just be a red hairring.Now this 1230 sighting is regarded as the last confirmed sighting of traveling so what could have happened to her in the six minute walk between her house and her store on a bus?

🎼Saday afternoon in a busy town center. Well, maybe some of the unconfirmed sightings can point to that.Reporting in the leader says that five minutes after she was leaving her house, walking in the direction of her shop, a woman matching her description was seen walking on the main road right off of market. It's called a 5. But this woman is walking in the opposite direction, like heading away from town and then someone matching her description is seen again around 345, even further down a5 farther away from town. So if that sighting is true, she could have walked away. sure but I.Li because she left her stuff behind including her car, which would have gotten her a lot farther a lot faster, and there's one more unconfirmed sighting that will probably make you realize why all these last ones are unconfirmed.🎼A woman says that at 4 PM on Saturday, she might have spotted travelling inside her store, possibly with a man, but she only caught a glimpse in the store. so she can't be 100% sure of anything. So police end up not really considering this a fully credible sighting. but if it was her, if there was a man, it actually might have been the younger man. if you remember him. Oh the.😮One that the gate at the other shop Yeah, so all the sightings Friday and early Saturday were of the older smartly dressed man but just before 6 pm there was a woman driving past tline shop and she said that there was a younger man in a trench coat standing outside the antique shop looking suspicious and she thinks thinks maybe that the door to tline shop was open Now to be clear, we never get a sketch of this guy and nobody says that he's the same younger man as,One from two days before like to me it's just it's odd and you said the store was locked when her husband found it right or the front door was locked at least right and he didn't have an extra key he only ended up getting in because he went around to the back where that door was open which by the way, that's kind of a red flag right it seems like it to me like if you left your antique shop unattended and you're gonna take the time to lock up when you leave like lock up when you leave that exactly Like I keep having this gnawing feeling that maybe she did make it back to the shop and then something happened.And thereMaybe the banana peel really is the one that she bought at lunch. Maybe that's why her compact was out and open like she was touching up like she got interrupted. Something happened and she was taken out the back. And maybe the back in two minute sign was put up because it was just the one that was sitting out and someone just like threw that sign up because it was right there in her handwriting. but like they were just trying to buy themselves some time. And I don't know there's just a lot that doesn't add up if traveling just walked.🎼A, which is maybe one of the many reasons why pretty early on, police openly say that they suspect foul play, and they say something really specific to a reporter with the Daily Post in November of 1991.A senior detective says that he believeds she was abducted and murdered, possibly after getting into a car with someone she knew I don't know where the car thing comes from I think there's loads about this case that have never been shared but there is one other report I can maybe tie this back to I didn't include this in the timeline even with the other unconfirmed sightings because those at least were reported and then rereported a few times this one I only found one time in an article from the Daily Telegraph data.July 13, 1992 and this one says that after she was seen walking away from town, so this would have been that 230 sighting or maybe the 345 but more likely the 230 After that, two people saw a woman who they say looked like treveline in the passenger seat of a car leaving town and at least one of the people who saw this said that the woman looked upset.うん。🎼So that's what we know. Okay, here, let's talk theories. What happened to travelling. What and who kept her from coming back in those two minutes. Well, the obvious place to start is with the mystery man..🎼Police soon begin to wonder if travelling met with foul play at the hands of the smartly dressed man because try as they might, they could not identify this mystery man. So why wouldn't he come forward unless he had something to hide, which, by the way, it's not like this story was easy to hide from a local news outlets were all over this. And then you had crime watch come in and take the story to an even bigger stage. So in the first year, this mystery mans sketch was ever.And still nobody comes forward to say like they even know who he is he just doesn't come forward I mean, they get plenty of calls from people who think that they might know the guy's identity I mean, at least one person suspects that it might be this other antique dealer who was in town that day which honestly would make so much sense like we know she often goes out to buy antiques we know she had money on her that day like maybe she just had sold something or was about to purchase something Yeah it seems like the most logical solution but.All the names of antique dealers that they get put forward to them, like they're able to quickly look into and rule out.

Don't buy the dealer thing like if this guy was just there to sell her something, why would he have hung around with her for like two days And like what the goal is to take that wad of money she was carrying with her on Saturday like why so long or maybe there was like something from her store and he's trying to like get her comfortable maybe he was a buyer I don't know if there was ever like a full inventory of the items that she had in stock or like things that she was expecting So I don't think we have specific things missing or anything Like again this is just a.🎼and one that police really buy into for a while. I mean, a bunch of news reports have them saying that they think the smartly dressed man could be in the antiques world and they even imply that the way he was dressed had to have had him there on business because one detective told a paper like, I mean, think about it. it's Saturday, Most people have this day off. Why is this dude who's still in a suit with a briefcase unless he's like there conducting business exactly, but they go through that world pretty thoroughly and they don't find this guy. So.Mystery man probably not in the antiques world after all So call me cynical which you do a lot obviously but cynical crime isn the same thing but isn't an affair like an equally likely possibility her husband's out of town she's seen around town with this other guy who like yeah I don't know he's not running to the police to give his story it just like has me very side eye The roomor mill in this small town is definitely churning and it seems like there was some gossip that maybe traveling was having an affair or.Affairs plural, but police never speak on this publicly I mean people are actually quite careful in news reports to just say that she had a lot of friends, both male and female like that's it.But let's speculate for a second What if she was having an affair and what if she was seeing this man while her husband was away working on their retirement home, something went south, Lord only knows what, but police keep calling this a murder investigation so let's call it what it is Was he from out of town like it's wild to me that nobody would have seen this man before with her like just in the couple of days leading up to her disappearance okay, fine, maybe but they have never tied this mystery man to a lover?Yeah.And also like this woman is everywhere with this man, like if this is an affair, she is not hiding it right like she's seeing people who know her that are like saying Oh she usually would have hit like she waves, she would have waved like we know this woman they're out and about on town together like something about this man being a lover just doesn't feel right to me I mean unless she was just totally checked out of her marriage I mean if she's planning on running off with this guy before Richard comes back in town maybe who cares who sees you maybe you're leaving breadcrumbs for your.So like they don't have to wonder where you went if you're by yourself or whatever but then take stuff with make a phone call when they don't get the hint and your story is national news and for those who know her leaving them without answers is the part that doesn't add up more than anything else like I said I mean for the first few years like her son Richard was adamant that his mom would not have left on her own few years did he end up changing its tune No so tragically like nine years after she went missing he actually does.I had of a heart attack I mean he was really young 37 my God but one of travelingline's brothers L, he's been really vocal in her son Richard's place he doesn't see a world where his sister just up in leaves without a word and listen I came into this case fresh off of listening to there's this podcast called the vanishing of Janice Rose so like I had a really solid example of what leaving a life looked like and all the people left behind who swore like that you never would but I mean it could be the case here like what do they know?I mean, might not be anything more than we do even though it's always a possibility that she ran off without taking anything with her statistically, it's not probable like it's so unlikely So then did mystery man kill her to me that's the only reason that he wouldn't come forward he's either with her or he did something to her or he helped her get away listen this is like a little fringe I'm literally like making up it as I go but they're like some weird piece.🎼to this that I don't think get enough weight. So for 10 years, they're looking for mystery Man. they get nothing. Tre just poof vanished into thin air. But then something weird happens. in 2001. Police formed something like a little task force to reexamine this cold case. One room,10 officers all dedicated to tracking tres and movements in the three days before she vanished. kind of sounds like writing a crime junk episode exactly.。And from this, they drop a bombshell they say the sketch of mystery man should be ignored what they give us nothing as to what happened why the sketch is wrong what about it is wrong like just kidd disregard Well here's what's so lots of people will talk about this case in a way that implies mysteryster man is no longer important but that's not what I read Nobody says he's not involved.Or he's no longer important to the case they just say that the sketch is inac I have a list of follow up questions because they had so many witnesses I know so was the sketch just wrong.

🎼And a decade on, they don't have much hope for witnesses giving them something useful. Or did they I him, But he turned out to not be important. And again, to be clear, that is not what they're saying when they're not saying anything. You right, But many years later, when the documentary in the footsteps of killers is produced or they do a single episode on this case. a woman named Linda is interviewed. And she says that shortly after Treveline went missing, she began.Dating one of Treveline's brothers Phil, they were together for like five years following the time she disappeared and when she's being interviewed, she's like, I don't know what all this mystery band talk is all about that man, that sketch is without a doubt her brother, Phil. Wait, what I'm confused Girll me too How would no one know it was her brother.あ。So Travelline has two brothers, right, Len and Phil okay Len lived in town, but Phil traveled for work a ton apparently, so locals probably wouldn't recognize him Myy got it Yeah, but in an article I found it says that he was in town that week from Switzerland and listen the side by side pictures of them are interesting.う。🎼Oh, that's the same man. Yeah, okay, And in every picture that this ex is showing in that episode, Phil is in a dark suit jacket. I mean, honestly, this makes sense to me. She's all over town with this guy doesn't really add up for a secret love affair, like nothing hide theres your brother. Yeah, there's nothing to hide if it's just your brother. So if it's true. she could have walked away. the problem I have, though, with this. Okay, it's Phil, how is this not confirm.Like Phil had to have heard about mystery Man he had to have mentioned to police all the times that he saw her when he was in town if that was him because that would be like very, very solidly confirmed sightings because like her brother is with her the whole time Right like in my mind I'm like, again, Linda' like oh, this is for sure her brother and I'm like I feel like police would know that so.は？🎼Is this terrible police work And also her brother, Phil is living under a rock or my only third option for mystery Man. What if she didn't leave with him at all What if he just helped her leave. unlessless an element, this one is the most far fetchtched. But if mystery man is Phil. And this wasn't the most bungled investigation of all time, That is the only thing that makes sense to me, The only reason he would be the guy who's seen with her over.And over for days, but then not admit it is if he knows where she is or is hiding her or helped her or something and is like protecting her by not saying anything Yes question mark, I don't, you know what I mean like it's the only thing that like it's the only way Phil makes sense to me Okay, where's Phil now can't please just talk to him No Phil Phil's dead now Okay, I only have more questions I know if it was him if she did leave willingly whether he helped her?Not what's the why Like why is she walking away from her whole life like with his help or without it there's no good explanation for that I mean all of the reporting talks about her being in this happy marriage she just opened this shop within like the last couple of years she's planning for retirement like his little house new grandbaby on paper life is 10 out of 10.Yeah.But the other bombshell that Phil's X dropped in that in the footsteps of Kill's episode is she says none of that is true that Treline wasn't happy, and she says that Richard wasn't all that nice of a guy, So I don't know maybe now that her son was married had a family of his own she wanted out while she still had some life to live, but just get divorced, I mean it seems like a way easier solution if that's what she wanted.But maybe it wasn't an option, or maybe she just didn't want to go that route.🎼Barring a situation where she was afraid of return. I would think that she'd want to take some stuff with her to start over like money her call. I mean, maybe she had someone else was helping her all a fill or a lover who is or isn't our mystery man or maybe she'd been preparing for this. I mean, remember, so there were those rumors of an affair were multiples ofs in town or whatever. Well, in the in the footsteps of killers episode. they actually talk of at least one affair.Like it is a sure thing.And they say that they learned she'd actually gotten an inheritance of like 10000 from a man that she'd been having an affair with who passed away. Now, I don't know when that was or if that money was still accounted for, but like if true, pretty interesting in my book, Yeah, that that does kind of change things I think the part of the reason I'm like, was it is because it doesn't seem to change things for police They say travelline was met with some sort of foul play at the hands of someone she.new which makes me go back to did they do a terrible job the first time around either ignore this or not dig deep enough to learn this or maybe like I said before, maybe it's not that interesting as the like documentary of the episode presents it to be So if this inheritance thing is real I imagine Richard had to have known about it right Like I can't imagine that one.

Over he might have I mean, maybe that's why he seems so willing to accept that she just left I mean Richard consistently is the one who talks to travelingline in early news reports like as though she's alive asking her to come home implying that she left on her own while her son and her brother but don't even seem to entertain the idea but if you believe that if Richard believed that she left if he knew why not allude to the fact that she had a reason to go instead of saying that you guys had like this.happyapp life, happy marriage, or whatever I mean to say face maybe, but there's another reason you do that too, if you want to divert attention, which brings me to theory number three, What if Richard did something to his wife?🎼Going back to 2001, after they brought that group of investigators together, this is the same time that they said the sketches inaccurate. They also arrest Richard. Oh, I'm sorry, you could have LED with that. Well, I'll tell you why I didn't. according to the BBC, after some questioning. Richard is released that same day without facing any charges. Police never call him a suspect. They also never explicitly say that he's cleared. The only official statement we could.F is that according to the BBC, they released him, quote,  pendingending further inquiries, and if they ever questioned him again, it again didn't result in any charges.Now the timing sure feels suspect to me Yeah, I mean you can see my face like hey, this picture we said was so important for a decade forget about that probably not accurate husband is arrested but timing feels calculated yeah to me at least it feels very like hint hint wink wink this is the direction we're looking without actually saying anybody is officially anything I can't put words.In police's mouth I can only tell you what they did because they never say anything about Richard and I don't have access to the police file so I can't tell you what they were thinking or even like I would die to know what came to the questioning or like what questions they I mean to be a fly on that wall and listen I have zero evidence backing this up but I wonder if in 2001 like could they have talked to Phil's X for the first time Like it makes sense to me that she would have never been spoken to early on because it seems like,Me right after traveling't so day one investigators miss her even people a couple of months on are like oh why would this new girlfriend who wasn't around have anything like just skip her But if she got in touch with investigators1011 years on and started telling them things The two bombs that she drops in that episode would explain to me the exact two things that happened right like 10% B1, she says I think mystery. Manmo is Phil picture gone and then bomb2 I didn't tell you the whole thing Yes she.🎼Sa that their marriage wasn't great, whatever whatever. she also said that sometime after traveling disappeared furniture and carpet were moved out of traveling Richard's home Wait but how does she know this Bill told her about the carpet and furniture and the two of them thought that it was so weird because if you still think your wife is going You're like you're her to come back in the news getting rid of a bunch in house is probably going be a shock to her Like is now really.The time and when was he supposed doing this like was he moving it to the retirement house maybe No no because he never ends up moving to the retirement house he ends up selling it and he ends up converting her antique shop to residential housing like rents it out So I mean I guess TBD timing maybe he was moving some of the furniture to the shop to furnish the apartment I don't know and I don't know exactly when the girlfriend heard about this or like when this exactly was supposed to happen I just know shortly after she went missing.う.She also says that after her and fill were together, Richard would come by the pub that she worked out to talk to her and looking back, she thinks that he was trying to find out what she knew or what Treveline's brothers were maybe talking to her about like a temperature check Yeah but she said it was so weird because like in all the times that he did talk to her he showed no emotion never asked questions, never said that he loved his wife missed his wife which she found weird but I don't know, so here's the thing like I know I tee this up being like you know her too.Phil is mystery man Richard removing carpet furniture and like they' not being happy Yeah maybe those two things explain what police did in 2001 but I also can't make those two things work together Phil as mystery man only make sense to me if he was like helping traveling get away which no one ever suggests to be true But then if he helped her get away, why is Richard moving furniture Richard has nothing to do with it Yeah, and even if he did that it's not suspicious Like it has nothing to do with.This case makes no sense, I mean you see why police is calling this one of the most confusing cases their department has ever worked ever seen yeah, so okay, can we just like pause for a second like go down a path with me if Richard is involved in some way break it down is his alibi of being out of town bogus I'm not gonna go down a path with you I'm going to take you down the rabbit hole with me let's go So Richard is supposed to be in Rudled right an hour away police had initially report.That he didn't get back until 5 pm.

？And I read somewhere that workers could confirm that he was at this bungalow where the work was being done, but I only saw that in like one article. and there was some stuff even saying that Richard and Traveline only had one car so he like couldn't have gotten back. but like in my mind I'm like but he did whether it's a five or whatever we know he gets back like maybe got a ride, I don't know. But anyways, if he's not back until five. he's in the clear since everyone believes something happened to her around 230 when she was last seen near her house.Well, fastfing forward at some point there are changes in news reports about when Richard gets home without any real explanation as to why all of a sudden it's changed Sometimes people call it lunchtime that he's back in that TV episode I was talking about they get more specific and say that a police source told them Richard was seen at a local pub at 230 230 like exactly when she goes missing yes, now a bunch of blogs that I've seen go.On the other extreme and they say that he was for sure in Rudlin and actually he kept calling the house and shop and when he couldn't get her, he called a neighbor to go check and they're the first to realize the shop is locked, they call and tell him he calls police maybe from Rudlin, but for the life of me, I have no idea where these blogs are getting that information because nothing even close to that is in the news reports that I have access to but even if he was there that whole time and calling.I'm not even sure that puts him in the clear in my mind I mean, without knowing the timing of the calls, I can't say if he did or didn't have time to go back and forth like between his bungalow and their home Did they ever do any of the searches for her up where the bungalow was Yes but not when or why you might think and really this is when and where our case becomes active like in present day and gets exceptionally more we.🎼So before I tell you what I'm about to tell you, let me set the stage a little bit. So there's this wild tip that police get in March 2019 based on all the reporting that was out there before. it seemed like these two men got a tip given to them that LED them to believe they knew where Trevoline's body was. and a ton happens after this. Police searched. they don't find anything. Then something even stranger happens. And then like a lot of people just end up writing these guys off like, oh, they're just.But when I was looking this case, I'm like why they have no connection to traveling, no reason to be doing this, they don't gain anything and they are still so convinced that their information is right, they say they have pictures but of course the pictures aren't published anywhere So obviously I need to get my hands on those pictures and what I really wanted to know is where did this tip originate from that is never reported on and to me it feels pretty.like can I solve Treveline's case from another country, probably not, but am I going to try 1,000% I couldn't call myself a crime junkie if I didn't.And this felt like the one place I knew I might actually get answers because unlike the rest of this story where everyone I wanted to talk to has already passed and can't give me the details I need, these two brothers, Andrew Sutton, an accountant and Lee Sutton, a carpenter. They're still alive and have connections to this little place you might have heard of for the first time today. Redlin, So I asked our reporter Taylor Hars to track them down and asked them how this tip came out and.This is a story that in Andrew's own words is stranger than fiction, so get ready.Andrew Sutton told us that in 2019, his brother Lee leaves the carpenter he was doing some construction work on a bungalow in Ruland, and when Lee mentions this to Andrew, Andrew thinks of Travelline, her case is like local lore in North Wales and when Andrew hears bungalow in Ruland like to him, there is only one bungalow in Ruland obviously that's not true, So not surprising when Lee brings it up to the owner and he's like no no no, this isn't the same.Bunggalow that traveling and Richard But actually, this guy that he's talking to remembers the case well too and he said that Richard used to spend quite a lot of time at the same bar that this guy did at the Rudling Go club which like nothing burger to Lee right Lee didn't really know about this case he's like okay cool he goes on with this day but as he's packing up at the end of the day he's making small talk with this guy asking him like oh do you still go to that pub at the golf club and the guys like no.I actually stopped going to Rudland Go Club because it started to smell inside and Lee said in that moment he literally dropped whatever was in his hand because he had heard that before So he said that back in 1990, Young Buck in his 20s, he was in the construction trade then like he is later, but he says back then he did work for this older guy and every day this guy did lunch at the golf club.Now this guy again, he seems to be retired whatever, and Lee said that he used to work at the golf club back in the day, so this was like his spot Lee knew his routine, he would leave, hed be gone.

For about an hour or so for lunch, come back.🎼Well, one day in 1990, he leaves for his lunch at the club. but he's back within like 15 minutes. So he's like, why back so soon? And this guy said that there was this terrible smell in the building. He like could not take it. Now, he confirmed guyy in 1990. and guy in 2019 did not know each other. Like he asked 2019 guy. So he's got two separate people over the course of almost 30 years telling him about this horrible smell at the club.In the summer of 1990Now his brother Andrew Sutton told us that 2019 guy said it wasn't just him that was bothered by the smell a lot of people were complaining about it so much so that they complained to staff at the golf club and he said the golf club was adding an extension at the time so employees reached out to the contractors and the contractors were basically like, you know, an animal must have just like gotten in under the floorboards and died and is that where the smell was coming from Like iss it where the construction was?So no that's the weird part but from what they were hearing, it was just like nobody wanted to deal they were kind of all satisfied saying like listen had to be an animal that died, it's decomposing yes the smell is horrible but it's eventually just going to go away on its own So as you can imagine, after Lee hears this he immediately calls his brother and is like hey, I asked about that bungalow not the one you're thinking of but you're never going to believe this and both of them are just kind of like stunned.？So they decide to go on a field trip like they got to see this thing for themselves right like because there's no way two random brothers, one who'd never even heard about the case, they're not going to find something that police haven't but what if again this is like sounding like the creation of a crime drinking episode So in the most responsible fashion they actually go to police first they make sure that they have this information to check it out and then they wait surely there's going to be a search or they're going to hear something bad.Hey, FYI, we looked into it, it's nothing like things for the tip.But they don't even when they try following up with police, police are like listen, we may look into it, we may not. It's like not your problem to worry about by, which isn't enough for them like they got to be in their bonnet about this thing now because Lee has been catching up on Trevline's case in this time. He watched the crime Watch special that was filmed within two months of Tre going missing and he sure didn't like how Richard, who, by the way, is already dead in 2019 when all this is happening Lee doesn't like how Richard.🎼Keep slipping into past tense now and then talking about his missing life, which we've seen before. and it always makes me side eye because you would have to consciously correct yourself if you knew something I know. and I honestly, when I first watched it like and I'm like the crime junkie, I didn't even pick up on the past tense thing my first go around the thing that like really kind of drove me up a wall is I noticed that in all of Richard's interviews anytime,He like talks about the police investigation he's like praising that like they did everything they could like they're doing a great job and maybe they did I'm just saying I've never seen a case where a missing person is never found over decades and the family is like you did all you could do like there was like I'm not saying there's there's a first time for everything but like there's usually like some hesitation some like what else could we have done like that we could have done this earlier we four other options but like it anyways all that.To say like they're honing in on their own things and the Sutton brothers are not going to let this go, I don't know if they would have called themselves crime junkies before, but Lee and Andrew, you are crime junkies.So at some point, Lee decides to go take a look at this floor for himself, like what's what, could a body be down there, could it just be an animal and when he does, he doesn't think that there's any way an animal could have gotten under this floor accidentally and died causing this smell, he thinks the only way something dead wound up under those floor boards would be if it was put there by someone.And they are going to figure out what it is if it is the last thing they do, and they know exactly how.So this building has an air brick right near where this smell originated from and I actually had to look up, I didn't know what an air brick was, it is exactly what it sounds, it's like shaped like a brick, but it has holes so like it's bented go through it Yes right there in the name Ashley.え。Now the holes are too small to actually see anything and it's obviously like dark under there, but Andrew knows a tool that they can use So one Saturday morning in March of 2019, they go to a hardware store and they buy a Stanley fiber optic LED inspection camera which is basically this tiny little thing that you hold it has a screen on the front and then it's like a little tube but like a scope Yeah that's the word man today so it has this little scope so you can put it in tiny hole so they buy this they go straight to the golf club.Specifically the bar and they're like sitting there inside like putting the batteries in, playing around with it, figuring out how it worked and coming up with a little white lie because they felt like if they told the people at the club that they're going go hunting around for a dead body like might not be welcome at the Yeah they're going to be super into it So when the guy at the club is like, oh, what are you doing with that they make up a story And one of them is like,

You know, my brother's going to buy this house and I want to check that the floors haven't like brought it out or whatever do you mind if I just test it out here and the guy's like sure whatever go for it Brentt?🎼Okay, I am going to show you the pictures. These have never been published before anywhere in the world. And this is what they see seconds after putting the camera through the air vent. Oh my God.😊.I wish the quality was better here the Stanley camera doesn't record it like that camera thing on it is just a viewer Yeah so what you're looking at is pictures that the brothers took of like the viewer screen or whatever I don't need it to be any clear Ash I't think I'm looking at a human skeleton I know and even like the printouts I feel like don't do it justice the second I saw it I'm like I mean I feel like skull eyes spine there's like maybe,ole in the skull it actually that's like more pronounced when you print it out I mean like I don't know I looked at this and I saw it the same way that I think that they did I saw it instantly I was a little surprised that apparently so our reporter saw it to So did another reporter we have who's a former detective but apparently everyone else in the office like didn't they were like oh yeah no there's nothing there So like I don't know if I'm the one who's losing it I was also one of those things like am I being biased like I know what I'm looking for so I'm seeing.one of those things but I mean what I doesn't look like anything else at least not to me And I told you these have never been published anywhere before even though these men have talked to news outlets Wait why not I don't know Like when we talked to Lee he said that they tried to get these pictures out there Like they've had interviews scheduled with other reporters who just ghosted them And then when they did a sit down with one journalist who actually heard them out, they never ended up publishing anything So Lee says they feel like they,Just keep like hitting brick wall after brick wall until we called Now they gave the photos to us no problem like they're dying for someone to take them more seriously it makes no sense to me and listen I mean like obviously I haven't been able to authenticate these photos I asked the brothers if any other people have tried and they said no truly when they were first just like talking about this and I hadn't seen them I was like you know what like thist me so vague you probably can't see anything that's why everyone writes them off like it's probably why everyone does want.Publish them they're blurry and it's like yeah vague I know, but then I see them and I'm like what are we doing here people So okay back to the story they stick the scope down the air brick they see this What do they do then Well they're in shock for a minute as you can imagine but they leave so they said that they left it was like a weekend and for like the weekend they're like staring at these pictures like this can't be real but like they really felt like it was real.So they took the pictures on March 14 On March 19, they come back to the golf club and they tell the people at the club what it is they found and they need to call police and Lee says that the guy that they were telling this to at the club just quote  went to pieces and was like, well, how do you know who is it how long is she been there and Lee obviously said he' like, you know't I don't know like we just know what our photos show there appears to be a body under the floor He said at that point there was this other woman who appears?she seemed to be in charge at the golf club as well and Lee said that she was asking about how this might affect their business Now, we tried calling the golf club ourselves to ask a manager about how all of this went down but when we did, the manager was already gone for the day or out of the office or in London and they have not called us back yet but we do know that staff at the golf club and the Sutton Brothers called police when Andrew and Lee showed them the photos and Andrew says that,Within a half hour, a large number of officers from Northern Wales PD show up they show them where they think the body is, show them the pictures and Lee says that he followed police inside to this room right above where they spotted the body and guess what's on the floor trap door It's like two feet by three feetish they estimate there's this big heavy freezer over part of it and Lee got a chance to get on the floor and really get like a.Look at it and here's the really interesting part He said that it looked like it had not been opened in a long time. I think the interesting part is that police are just letting him examine this with them I think he like snuck in I guess he was wearing something that like maybe similar to what you might be wearing if you were actually going go in that crawl space to collect the body and there were like so many people he kind of just like slipped right in there but once they realized who he was, they did kick him out but importantly, he said that as he's leaving.He can hear them like prying the door open and he could hear the nail screeching in a way that you only hear when something is like decades old So he's the carpenter brother right so like he kind of knows what he's talking about Yeah and he's like I'm walking out I'm like this is it they're gonna find her but this is like when he's getting shoot out so they make him go outside where Andrew was waiting and then they're moved even farther away from where the work is being done and it's weird this officer who is leading them away Lee says.

He says the strangest thing to him, he says that their photos would never hold up in court and leaves's like court like who's talking about court like what it's just weird, but I don't know in the moment whatever So they're in the clubhouse just waiting and the officer in charge comes back to Lee and Andrew and says, hey, we want you to put your camera back in just like see what you can see so they go back, they put their camera back in.And this is what they see, where to go, where'd what go?Don't do that Where's the skeleton police say there never was a skeleton They say they found nothing Now that's what we get in the official reporting when police talked to news outlets, we searched, we found nothing Andrew and Lee told us though that as they were pulling the camera out I mean confused as hell about what was going on Yeah they said like again, as it's coming out they spot something a bone maybe like 10 inches long and,🎼Li starts getting all excited. He's like there okay, do you see this Yeah and he shows the camera to the detective inspector and they get no explanation like nothing. They are just asked to leave, go to the station for statements, which they do. they go, they give statements and they leave thinking that they're going to hear something about the bone that they saw altogether. but they don't the next day, they just get a call and police say there is nobody But then then what am I looking at back here. What is that.Yeah, the brothers feel crazy Like I said before, they've met with reporters they've met with people who the ones who did that like episode on this case, but they feel like they're screaming into the void Yeah, Ash there was a body there according to police there was not but if these pictures are real then then then I would think someone moved her body and that's exactly what the Sutton brothers think happened specifically they think someone in,The police department removed it they're pretty vocal about this theory and Lee posts about it all the time on his social media but of course, I mean there's no real evidence to support this and like there's if there's nobody there's nobody to remove and we don't have a statement from the police department on this So like why the policea my first thought went to someone at the golf club I mean there was like four or five days between them putting scope down taking the pictures and then when they go back to call police.It seems like that's what seemed like the obvious answer to me, but I mean in talking to the brothers, what makes them so convinced of their theory is they always point back to the trap door, they say that there's absolutely no other way to get to that spot where they think the skeleton was other than the trap door and Lee is adamant that when he saw that trap door and heard it being removed, he knew that that thing had been shut tight when police opened it and that when they're opening it that was the first time that that had been done in like decades, but how would they remove akele.With all of those people I mean he said there was like a crowd dude with no one noticing I don't know and also why like a cover up like this would take a lot of people why would a lot of people have a vested interest in this I say and to protect who like there's a lot of question marks as like what the motive would be to do this to me the only person who wins if she's not found there is the golf club right but again, the brothers don't leave a lot.Room for who they point squarely at police and they even end up filing a formal complaint against the police criticizing their handling of the case.The independent Office of police conductduct reviewed the complaint and then sent the matter back to the police department that was being that they're making the complaint against like there listen, this is like an internal matter you I should handle it and the police department is like we reject this complaint this complaint on this case that didn't happen to them Ca closed on their end So that's it The brothers are written off as Looney Rands who imagined this whole thing while I'm over here like what did they?いう？Yeah, I mean, let's hang out here just a minute longer if there really was a body under the floorboards, if it really was put there the summer of 1990, if it was treline to me that kind of points to just one person.うん。And Andrew and Lee have a whole theory about this They say that they've heard Richard and Treveline were having problems and that she was actually on the verge of leaving him, which they think led to some sort of altercation and ultimately her death and we know his bungalow was close by the golf club and he by his own o says he's in Rudland when she goes missing right like that was his alibi the whole thing started because someone who used to go there, says in 1990, Richard drank at the golf.Club bar and we weren't able to verify this, but Andrew and Lee say they even believed that Richard was working as a handyman at the golf club that summer What I know Wait what did he do for a living Like was he always a handyman He worked in maintenance I think it was like like a chemical plant so like it's totally plausible that he could have been doing work there Again, we haven't heard back from anyone at the golf club so we haven't been able to confirm this But anyways, the brothers are saying that they heard this from.People.

Because obviously people telling them to like, Sho shoot shoot, go away like this doesn't make them less interested in this and they have talked to a lot of people about it since.So they think Richard would have had access to a storage room off the kitchen where they say there was a trap door leading underneath the floor and they think that he could have put T's body under there to cover up a crime I mean hypothetically it could work he gets back to link Alin scoops her up in the car I mean she get in with him someone she knew or or maybe something happens in her shop he drives her off to another town listen, what's so weird to me is on.I've read police never even searched the whole Ruudland area back then by the way, so like I mean she totally could have been hidden away if she was there and then he ends up selling the bungalow so even he doesn't keep ties to that town but when would he have put her under the floor I mean she went missing on a Saturday you can't just like walk into a golf club on a Saturday afternoon and hide a dead body under the bar like no what's the timing of it then I don't know like she would have had to have been somewhere else at least for a little while.hi like I don't know whatever that's doable The part that's outlandish to me is how balsy you would have to be to put anything dead under the floor and not expect someone to go looking for it like yeah, who doesn't know that a body is going start to smell especially when you like have this other house of theirs right like well that's like the bunga is right there where like no one else is Yeah if someone would have like smelled this and gone looking for it and found that it was travelingline like he's right there there would have been no one else.To blame but him Well yeah and that doesn't really make sense to me either if there was a trap door there why didn't they go looking for the smell9 like in 90 like I have we know it was bad for business people left Well the only thing the only thing I can think is that maybe it was already nailed shut or then crack it open maybe if you think it's a raccoon you're like what I don't know maybe maybe the smell wasn't as bad as everyone remembered I don't know I have spiraled on this.I'm even like, I mean, I've gone to like who own the golf club in 90 like online property records for North Wales like they don't go back that far would someone have kept such a big secret for Richard is everyone still keeping the secret and that's why the body was moved but like why would a whole department be hiding a secret for a dead man Richard died in 2014 like dude this is.Was there no after all, but wait, just when you start thinking that this happens?In 2021, this small metal plaque seems to appear mysteriously one day bolted to a bench on a walkway just outside of Rudlin, no one knows when exactly it got there or who put it there and it looks like one of those little memorial plaques that usually say like in memory of whoever, except this message looks handmade like someone actually scratched a message into the metal, a message that reads in memory of traveling.Evans vanished 1661990 found Rudlin GC1432019 removed1932019 RIP. So the Sutton Brothers put it there That was my first thought, but they say that they're not responsible for it. They actually think that it might have been a relative of ts or maybe someone from the police department who put the plaqueup.who maybe was there while they were excavating and like I don't know this is their way of like whistleblowing but again, there's like no evidence to back that up so I don't And this is like a public bench like it's owned by the town it is but I mean this is definitely not like a town sanction plaque Like the local government actually had it removed but then another one pops up this time outside an old miners cottage a few minutes away from the first bench This one's same size, same material, same like sketchy handwriting.🎼But the message is longer this time. I'm going to have you take a look at this one instead of reading it. You can do it.Justice awaits those responsible for the removal and disposal of travelling Evans in this life or the next from Ruling Golf Club on March 19, 2019 at noon, and may the Lord have mercy upon their souls.Nude is specific, I know I can't find anything about what time of day the like LA search for her or whatever took up the floor and of course, like no one knows who put this plaque up either.Now it's been quiet since 2021, but maybe that's because no one was listening. If enough people talk about this case, talk about these pictures, maybe more people will feel comfortable coming forward and speaking if they know something.There's been a fifth theory explored over the years that, you know, traveling could have just been in the wrong place at the wrong time and gotten caught in the crosshairs of a stranger, perhaps a serial killer.In 2011, police explored this avenue and looked into two different serial killers in the area. Robin Les and Christopher Halllywell, Robin killed a few men in the area around that time, one of whom was an antiques dealer, but they couldn't find any solid connection to traveling, or actually any other female.

Victims as far as I can tell all his victims were male, so it seems like he was ruled out, and then with Christopher, he did kill women, and apparently he used to work as a window cleaner who had a habit of stealing antiques and back when travelingre disappeared he was apparently working in North Wales.But they've never been able to definitively tie him to Treline's case either, and sure, a serial killer is possible, but is it probable, right?Who was the mystery man Where does he fit into all of this does he exist or is he a fiction of everyone's imagination like police say the skeleton under the floor was for the Sutton Brothers someone out there can answer that question and if that's you, you can email me tips at audiochuck.com I'll be looking for your message.🎼 You can find all the source material for this episode on our website, crimejuie.com and if you want to listen to more episodes like this and all of our episodes completely ad free, be sure to join the fan club you'll also get early access to new episodes every week and you can follow us on Instagram@ crimemejuie podcast we'll be back next week with a brand new episode.🎼 Crime junkie is an audio Chuck production, I think Chuck would approve.
